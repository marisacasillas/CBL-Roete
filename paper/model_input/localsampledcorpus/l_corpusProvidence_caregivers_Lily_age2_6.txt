# Flounder
# Ariel was supposed to sing for the first time in front of her father king Triton and all the other mer
# but for now she was much more interested in sunken ships than her father's concert
# while they were searching Flounder began to get nervous
# what was that he said
# did you hear something
# suddenly a very large
# shark smashed through the side of the ship
# swim a shark Flounder cried
# they swam away very quickly
# Ariel and Flounder found a safe spot where the shark couldn't reach them
# you big bully Flounder shouted at the shark
# as soon as she was sure they were a safe distance from the shark Ariel thanked Flounder for being so brave
# even though he was a very small fish he had a very big heart and he was Ariel's best friend under the sea
# after their adventure Ariel and Flounder headed home hoping that they would not be too late for her father's concert
# ooh it's a big concert
# what's the octopus playing
# right
# and what's Sebastian doing
# what is he
# he's the conductor and he's conducting the orchestra

# all of Cinderella's friends clapped and chirped as they gathered around
# they loved their Cinderellee
# oh dear said Cinderella with a sigh there's so much to do
# I can only go if I've finished my chores and today Stepmother has given me more work than ever
# there's washing mending ironing cooking scrubbing sweeping
# suddenly three loud shrieks came from downstairs
# Cinderella come down here immediately and help us get ready for the ball her stepsisters cried
# her cruel stepmother and stepsisters wouldn't give poor Cinderella any time to do the rest of her chores
# mend my dress screeched Anastasia
# polish my shoes whined Rosella
# iron my cloak demanded her stepmother
# are they nice
# no they're not so nice
# but is Cinderella nice
# she's nice
# and are Cinderella's friends nice
# yes
# hours later Cinderella began to sweep and scrub the endless stone floor
# suddenly Jack had an idea
# I know he said
# we'll help Cinderella
# all the other mice nodded in agreement
# what would I do without you she said patting each of them on the head
# you're so good to me
# everyone joined in the cleaning singing happily as they went
# as she worked Cinderella began to imagine the magical evening ahead
# everyone would be dressed in the finest clothes and Cinderella would wear her mother's beautiful gown
# the ballroom would come alive with music dancing and laughter and the prince would bow before Cinderella and ask her to dance
# suddenly Cinderella stopped dreaming
# oh no she cried I've never been to a ball
# I don't even know how to dance
# dontchu worry Cinderella Jacques smiled reassuringly
# we'll show you 0how to dance easy as pie
# with that Jack bowed before Perla and extended his hand
# dance please Missy he asked
# Perla blushed as she took Jack's hand
# Gus was the conductor and he got all the birds to sing
# Jack and Perla spun round and around gliding across the floor
# Cinderella watched and copied their movements
# just listen and move see said Perla
# not so scary
# using her broom as an imaginary partner Cinderella danced and twirled gracefully through the room
# she led everyone across the floor sweeping and cleaning as they went
# good Cinderella said Jack beaming
# lucky prince gets to dance with Cinderellee
# the mice collapsed on the floor laughing

# oh there's Ariel
# a Special surprise
# the underwater kingdom was quiet and peaceful
# every mermaid and merman was in bed fast asleep
# everyone except princess Ariel and her friend Flounder
# hurry up Flounder cried Ariel
# it's almost time for the party
# we can't be late
# trying not to make sound Ariel and Flounder swam away from king Triton's palace
# they began their journey toward the surface
# but Ariel said Flounder are you sure we should go to the surface
# remember last time
# your father got so angry
# you know how he feels about humans
# that's right this time we can't get caught said Ariel
# she wasn't to let anything ruin her plans for tonight
# prince Eric the prince Ariel had saved in a shipwreck was having a royal ball
# and Ariel had a very special surprise for him
# swim faster Flounder she cried glancing back at him
# and Flounder raced to catch up
# just as Ariel and Flounder approached the surface Ariel saw beautiful lights dance across the water
# I don't think anyone's wearing yellow there are they
# no
# what do you think's happening
# well I guess prince Eric is out on the balcony
# he just didn't feel like joining in the royal celebration
# he cou
# Melody is crying

# she just wanted to go swimming right

# she went back in the sea again
# yeah
# she was happy there right
# did she go with Sebastian
# yeah
# Sebastian fell in the water again
# yeah
# prince Eric stood on the palace balcony
# he couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious girl with the lovely voice who had saved his life
# Flounder spotted the prince first
# look Ariel he said pointing a fin at the castle
# Ariel's heart leapt with joy when she saw Prince_Eric
# it's time for my surprise she said winking at Flounder
# swimming up to a nearby rock Ariel and Flounder hid behind it
# ready asked Flounder
# with a nod Ariel closed her eyes opened her mouth and began to sing
# suddenly the night was filled with the sweet sound of Ariel's voice
# she sang a song she had written just for Eric
# it was Ariel's special gift for him
# hearing her beautiful voice again Eric's face lit up
# it can't be he said
# I must be hearing the sounds of the wind
# still he remained on the balcony enchanted by the beautiful song
# when the song was over Eric looked out across the sea
# he hoped to catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl who had saved him
# who are you he called out into the night
# but all he heard was the echo of his own voice
# I'll be back soon Ariel whispered as she and Flounder swam toward home
# what are you doing silly
# you're all tangled up in the wire
# let me get you untangled

# what's Corduroy looking for
# I donno
# tadah
# tadah
# tadah
# oh my gosh what do you say
# you're welcome
# please
# hm
# what's this book about
# Corduroy
# is Corduroy a little bear
# what's he wearing
# is he wearing overalls
# yes
# what color are they
# oh
# late one summer afternoon Lisa and her mother took their laundry to the laundromat
# as always on such trips Lisa took along her toy bear Corduroy
# a laundromat was a busy place at this hour
# now Corduroy you sit right here and wait for me Lisa said
# I'm going to help with our wash
# Corduroy waited patiently
# Lisa's mother was saying be sure to take everything out of your pockets Lisa dear
# you don't want your precious things to get all wet and soapy
# pockets said Corduroy to himself
# I don't have a pocket
# he slid off the chair
# I must go find something to make a pocket out of he said and he began to look around
# first he came to a pile of fancy towels and wash
# then he saw a huge stack of colorful clothes in a laundry basket
# there ought_to be something in there to make a pocket out of he said
# without hesitating he climbed inside the bag which was filled with pieces of wet laundry
# the dampness didn't bother Corduroy in the least
# this must be a cave he said sighing happily
# I've always wanted to live in a dark cool cave
# when the time came for Lisa to fetch her bear he was gone
# oh Mommy she said Corduroy isn't here where I left him
# I'm sorry Honey said her mother but the Laundromat will be closing soon and we must be getting home
# Lisa was reluctant to leave without Corduroy but her mother insisted
# you can come back tomorrow she said
# I'm sure he will still be here
# as they left a young man wearing an artist's beret was taking his wet laundry out of a bag
# before he knew it Corduroy was being tossed together with all the sheets and shirts and shorts and slacks
# into the dryer
# but just as the artist was shutting the glass door Corduroy tumbled out onto the floor
# how in thunder did that bear ever get mixed up with my things the artist wondered
# poor Corduroy was damp all over
# the least I can do for him is give his overalls a good drying said the man thoughtfully
# he unbuttoned Corduroy's shoulder straps and put his overalls in the dryer
# Corduroy grew dizzy as he watched the clothes spinning round but the artist became inspired
# this would make a wonderful painting he said as he took out his sketch pad and began drawing the swirling colors
# I can hardly wait to get back to my studio
# finally the dryer stopped whirling and the man gathered up the clothes
# and he helped Corduroy put on his warm dry overalls
# all at once the manager of the laundromat called closing time everybody out
# Corduroy was gently placed on top of a washing machine
# I wonder who that bear belongs to said the artist as he was leaving
# it seems to me he should have his name someplace
# he's too fine a fellow to be lost
# as soon as the lights were turned off Corduroy began searching
# began his search again
# he was surprised to see something white glowing in the dark
# what is it
# maybe it's snow he said
# I've always wanted to play in the snow
# he accidentally tipped over the open lidded box and suddenly he was covered in soft slippery soap flakes
# it's soap
# gradually Corduroy began to slip and slide
# what fun he said with a smile
# I've always wanted to ski down a steep mountainside
# he landed paws first in an empty laundry basket
# this must be a cage he said
# I've never wanted to live inside a cage
# but by now Corduroy was drowsy and soon he nodded off to
# oh he's sleeping
# next morning when the manager came to open the door of the laundromat Lisa was waiting
# I left something here yesterday she said
# may I look around
# certainly said the manager
# my customers are always leaving things
# Lisa was searching under the chairs and in back of the washing machines when he
# when he
# when she heard the manager call her
# is this whatchor looking for senorita
# yes he's my best friend shouted Lisa as she came running
# she reached in and picked Corduroy out of the basket
# so this is where you've been you little rascal she said
# it's time I took you home
# Lisa thanked the manager and ran out of the door down the street holding Corduroy tightly in her arms
# why did you wander away she said
# I went looking for a pocket said Corduroy
# oh Corduroy why didn't you tell me you wanted a pocket asked Lisa giving him an affectionate squeeze
# the very next morning Lisa sewed a pocket on Corduroy's overalls
# and here's a card I've made with your name on it for you to keep tucked inside
# that's his little pocket
# I've always wanted a purple pocket with my name inside said Corduroy as he and Lisa nuzzled noses
# that's some thread
# that Lisa used to sew the pocket on
# wow
# that's great
# well you want Mommy to pick it out
# oh you wanna pick it out
# okay
# you have_to carry your box
# you want me to hold your milk
# okay
# what would be a good book to read
# are those good to read

# what's he wearing on his humps
# hats where should he be wearing the hats
# that's right
# because a snake would lose it

# because a mouse could get lost in a hat
# oh my gosh
# because a sheep might find it terribly hot

# because a moose could never manage
# he got his antlers stuck in his suspenders
# oh my gosh
# because possums might wear it upside down by mistake
# because possums like to hang upside down

# like to hold a back
# oh boy look Disney princess stories
# wow
# sure
# remember what this one's called
# what's it called
# beauty
# and the beast
# long ago an enchantress cast a spell on a castle and she transformed the handsome young prince into a hideous beast
# and his servants into household objects
# just look at me grumbled the beast I've been so cruel holding Belle captive in my castle how will she ever see me as anything but a monster
# come now said Mrs Pots gently all you have_to do is show her what's inside your heart you must act like a gentleman Lumiere said
# be romantic compliment her and most of all be kind gentle and sincere
# and don't be so grumpy added Chip Mrs Pots young son
# Mrs Pots gave her son a stern look but they all knew Chip was right
# who's that
# Lumiere
# I have an idea said the beast smiling why don't I invite Belle to go on a sleigh ride
# it just snowed outside and she might like the fresh air
# perfect said Lumiere a wonderful idea agreed Mrs Pots
# very romantic
# bless you
# added Chip that's enough out of you Mrs Pots said to Chip trying not to smirk
# the beast Lumiere to extend his invitation
# that sounds lovely said Belle I've been stuck in this castle far too long
# she ran down the long staircase and stepped outside
# glimmering white snow flakes fell from the sky it was a perfect white day
# just then the beast pulled up in a gleaming horse drawn sleigh
# how beautiful exclaimed Belle
# the beast smiled as he took her hand and helped her into the sleigh
# he didn't mention he had slept all morning polishing it just for her
# once she was settled he covered her with a warm blanket
# they took off across the powdery snow Belle laughed happily as the beast guided the sleigh through the forest path
# soon they came to a clearing in the woods before then was a frozen pond
# the beast pulled on the reins and stopped at the the edge of the pond
# this is such a magical place said Belle how did you ever find it
# I used to come here long ago said the beast it was one of y favorite places and I wanted to share it with you
# then the beast took out a picnic basket filled with snacks
# what are they eating
# they have hot chocolate
# and cookies
# right and
# and fruit and bread too
# that sounds like a good snack doesn't it
# mm yummy
# when they had finished their meal the beast asked Belle if she wanted to ice skate
# oh yes she said father and I used to go every winter I love ice skating
# soon Belle was spinning effortlessly across the pond's smooth surface
# the beast was less graceful hitting a bump in the ice he lost his balance and toppled to the ground
# at first he was angry but then he saw Belle looking at him kindly
# remembering his friends' advice he smiled as Belle helped him to his feet
# every one falls sometimes said Belle it's part of learning
# before long they were gliding across the ice arm in arm enjoying each other's company in the crisp winter air
# they grew tired and decided to rest
# just then a timid fawn wandered out of the forest
# poor thing said Belle she looks scared and hungry
# taking an apple from their picnic basket Belle showed the beast how to gently feed the young deer
# soon the sun was setting it was time to go as they made their way home Belle thought about the day she had spent with the beast
# there was something different about him he had shown her a kinder softer side
# perhaps they could be friends after all
# is that what comes next
# oh
# what's this one called
# right is it called the dance lesson
# mm
# how do you ask nicely
# just imagine said Cinderella excitedly there's a ball at the palace tonight in honor of the prince
# and every maiden in the land is invited
# that means me too
# all of Cinderella's friends clapped and chirped as they gathered around
# they loved their Cinderella
# oh dear said Cinderella with a sigh there's so much to do
# I can only go if I finish my chores
# and today step mother has given me more work than ever
# there's washing mending ironing cooking scrubbing sweeping
# suddenly three loud shrieks came from downstairs
# Cinderella come down here immediately and help us get ready for the ball he step sisters cried
# mend my dress polish my shoes iron my cloak
# hours later Cinderella began to sweep and scrub the endless stone floor
# suddenly Jacques had an idea
# I know he said we'll help Cinderella and all the other mice nodded in agreement
# what would I do without you Cinderella said patting them on the head you're so good to me
# everyone joined in the cleaning singing happily as they went
# as she worked Cinderella began to imagine the magical evening ahead
# everyone would be dressed in the the finest clothes Cinderella would wear her mother's beautiful gown
# the ballroom would come alive with music dancing and laughter and the handsome young prince would bow before Cinderella and ask her to dance
# suddenly Cinderella stopped dreaming oh no she said I've never been to a ball I don't even know how to dance
# don't worry Cinderella Jacques smiled reassuringly
# we'll show you how to dance easy as pie
# with that Jacques bowed before Perla and extended his hand
# dance please he asked Perla blushed as she took Jaques' hand
# Gus was the conductor he got all the birds to sing
# Jacques and Perla spun around and around gliding across the floor
# honey is the mouse's name Jack or Jacques
# it's Jacques and Gus
# okay
# Cinderella watched and then copied their movements
# just listen and move see said Perla not so scary
# using her broom as an imaginary partner Cinderella danced and twirled gracefully through the room she led everyone across the floor sweeping and cleaning as they went
# good Cinderella said Jacques beaming a lucky prince gets to dance with Cinderelli
# and the mice collapsed on the floor laughing thank you so much Cinderella said to her friends
# with your help tonight might be the night all my dreams come true
# it is Ariel next look at that
# a special surprise
# is Ariel swimming
# who's she swimming with
# flounder wow
# are they friends
# please
# the underwater kingdom was quiet and peaceful
# every mermaid and merman were in bed fast asleep
# everyone but princess Ariel and her friend flounder
# hurry up flounder cried Ariel it's almost time for the party we can't be late
# trying not to make a sound Ariel and flounder swam away from king Triton's palace
# they began their journey towards the surface but Ariel said flounder are you sure we should go to the surface
# remember the last time your father got so angry
# you know how he feels about humans
# that's why this time
# okay
# oh you need blankie oopy
# got it
# okay
# yes
# prince Eric the prince Ariel had saved in a ship wreck was having a royal ball
# Ariel had a very special surprise for him
# swim faster flounder she cried flounder raced to keep up
# just as Ariel and flounder approached the surface Ariel saw beautiful lights dance across the water
# when they poked their heads out of the water Ariel and flounder saw colorful lights explode in the air above prince Eric's castle
# I've never seen anything so beautiful in all my life said Ariel
# the human world is a wonderful place
# sure is pretty said flounder
# do you think prince Eric is happy
# or do you
# think he's sad
# he's happy oh good
# off in the distance prince Eric stood on the palace balcony
# he couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious girl with the lovely voice who had saved his life in the ship wreck
# why has she disappeared he wondered
# flounder spotted the prince first
# look Ariel he said
# Ariel's heart leapt with joy when she saw prince Eric
# it's time for my surprise she said winking at flounder
# swimming up to a nearby rock Ariel and flounder hid behind it
# ready asked flounder
# with a nod Ariel closed her eyes opened her mouth and began to sing
# do you need me to get blankie honey
# what's blankie doing
# he's on
# the ground
# oh my
# gosh what's he doing on the ground
# you can't reach blankie
# you gonna go find blankie and bring him home
# please
# okay let me put it back on for you
# you have_to hold onto it
# be gentle with it don't hurt it
# what do you say into your microphone
# hello
# how are
# you
# what's new
# can you say hi Amanda
# should we keep reading
# gentle with that okay
# suddenly the night was filled with the sweet sound of Ariel's voice
# she sang a song she had written just for Eric
# it was Ariel's special gift to him
# hearing her beautiful voice again Eric's face lit up
# it can't be he said I must be hearing the sounds of the wind
# still he remained on the balcony enchanted by the beautiful song filling the night air
# when the song was over Eric looked down across the sea
# he hoped to catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl who had saved him
# who are you he called but all he heard was the echo of his own voice
# I'll be back soon Ariel whispered
# just wait and see
# okay
# whatever could be keeping the dwarves said Snow White
# it's getting late
# and they should be home from the diamond mine by now
# while she waited Snow White busied herself tidying up the cottage in the woods
# what messy little fellows she said
# just then Happy came through the front door
# he tugged on Snow White's long yellow skirt
# what
# Snow White he said come quickly a young deer is hurt in the woods
# oh no cried Snow White the poor thing we must hurry
# they soon reached a small clearing and everyone stood in a circle around the deer
# do you know what the dwarves' names are
# well I think there's Happy
# and there's Grumpy he looks Grumpy right
# and that's Dopey
# and that's Sneezy he's always sneezing
# that's Doc he's the doctor
# and there's Bashful
# and there's Sleepy I think
# is so sleepy sleepy
# he is yawning cause he's so tired
# oh
# to take a nap he's so tired
# he must be cold said Snow White covering the deer with her long cape
# maybe he's just tired said Sleepy yawning
# a nice long rest should do the trick
# mommy's yawning too
# what a big yawn
# well you could be right Sleepy said Snow White but
# he's not closing eyes
# his eyes
# and that's Dopey right
# yeah
# maybe he has a hachoo a cold said Sneezy
# he looks like he might be a little bit stuffy
# well that's possible but he probably would've stayed in his thicket until he was feeling better said Snow White
# I know said Happy maybe he's feeling sad and needs a little cheering up
# I'm sure that would help Happy but it looks like he may need something more than a merry story or a song
# I I don't know for sure said Bashful softly
# but perhaps he's too shy to let us know what's the matter
# we all feel shy sometimes don't we Bashful said Snow White
# then Dopey started pacing back and forth and pointing over his shoulder
# hm said Snow White you could be right Dopey
# he could be lost
# I bet I know what happened grumbled Grumpy
# the wicked queen probably cast a spell on him
# she's always up to no good
# suddenly Doc pushed his way past the others and approached the deer
# may I lake a took
# I mean take a look he said adjusting his eye glasses
# and he knelt down beside the deer
# well would you look at that cried Doc
# the poor deer must have stepped on a
# a thorn ouch
# Doc gently removed the sharp thorn and the deer jumped up and licked him
# how relieved you must be cried Snow White
# now run along home she said to her new friend your family must be worried
# the deer licked Snow White's hand and ran into the forest
# that's the deer
# oh &-uh the bushes you mean
# yeah
# that's the deer's ear
# this is
# these are the bushes the green bushes you mean
# that's just the sky
# yeah that's
# the sky see there's a bush there and then the
# all the yellow stuff even behind him there is the sky
# right
# that's a little piece of sky
# right
# I'm so proud of each and every one of you
# said Snow White
# the sky is on him
# oh no
# he's got
# he's got a spotted fur
# he
# yeah
# that night Snow White and the seven dwarves made a delicious dinner
# then when they had all had their fill they sang and dances until it was time for bed
# yey
# oh what's this one about
# it's about Jasmine and what's his name
# Aladdin
# Aladdin and Jasmine had just gotten married
# people had come from near and far to celebrate
# it had been the largest wedding in the history of Agraba
# now Aladdin and Jasmine were preparing to take a trip far far away
# Abu stay out of those bags warned Aladdin smiling at his curious little friend
# that food is for our trip
# Jasmine's going to be so surprised when she sees what I've planned
# she has lived most of her life within the walls of this palace and now we are going to see the world together
# soon Aladdin and Jasmine stood on the balcony ready to begin their adventure
# the magic carpet awaits you said Aladdin
# you're going to see things you've never seen before a whole new exciting world Aladdin replied
# let's get going said Jasmine I can't wait
# Jasmine Aladdin and Abu settled on the magic carpet
# then they took off soaring high above the palace
# Jasmine laughed with delight the wind blowing her long hair behind her
# look how small everything looks she said
# it's like a dream
# after a little while the magic carpet began its descent
# are we there asked Jasmine
# almost said Aladdin
# close your eyes I want this to be a surprise
# suddenly the magic carpet landed on top of a high cliff and Jasmine heard a noise that sounded like crashing water
# oh what is it
# it's water it's the ocean
# Jasmine couldn't believe her eyes she'd never seen anything so beautiful
# the water was a brilliant shade of turquoise and dolphins leapt in and out of the water as if they were dancing
# huge ocean waves crashed onto a white sandy beach
# in the distance
# she have a skirt on
# did
# we see the ocean when we were with Tamar and Rafi on the beach
# yeah and we saw the crashing waves
# we saw waves
# there
# another wave and
# what kind of birds did we see
# what kind of birds were we chasing on the beach
# seagulls you're right
# right
# they flew away we didn't catch them
# right
# and did we play on the beach too
# yeah and did we go to the library with Tamar
# that was fun wasn't it
# hm
# they had a wonderful time swimming and enjoying the sun and
# when he and Jasmine were ready to go Aladdin snapped his fingers
# time for our next destination he said
# within seconds the magic carpet appeared
# once again Aladdin asked Jasmine to cover her eyes as they descended Jasmine felt the air grow colder
# okay Jasmine you can open your eyes now
# what did they see
# snow
# what is it Jasmine asked bending down to touch the cold white powder
# it's snow answered Aladdin isn't it wonderful
# it falls from the sky when it's cold
# it's amazing cried Jasmine it looks like a soft white cloud
# watch out she called Abu had thrown a snowball and it was headed straight for Aladdin
# they spent the rest of the day playing in the snow and built snow
# they even used the magic carpet as a sled to slide down a nearby hill
# soon the sun began to set and the air grew tolder  colder
# I think it's time to take off said Aladdin
# you show me places so different from Agraba
# there are plenty of brand new worlds for us to share said Jasmine
# and as they made their way back to the palace Jasmine smiled
# she knew this was just the beginning of their wonderful life together
# it was
# time to go right it was getting late
# yeah
# they
# need to go to sleep right
# I hope they ate their dinner already
# do you think they did
# and they danced too
# and
# and
# right you
# right
# is that what you do before you go to bed you dance
# yeah
# oh no
# they crashed into the snow
# and then
# you got a leaf in your hair
# who did
# you
# did who crashed into the snow
# was it the Brute family
# the little
# chicks
# you're so silly
# that's from a
# like some of the stuff that she says all just comes from books that she's read like
# they were clumsy and they didn't know how to ride their sled and they crashed head first into the snow

# what was that he asked did you hear something
# suddenly a very large shark smashed through the side of the ship
# swim a shark Flounder cried
# they swam away very quickly Ariel and Flounder found a safe spot where a shark couldn't reach them
# you big bully Flounder shouted at the shark
# as shoe as soon as she was sure oh

# kay Franklin's class trip
# Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
# he had gone with his class to the bakery the fire station and the pet store
# today Franklin's class was going to the museum
# Franklin was so excited that he could hardly eat his breakfast
# the museum had lots_of steps and huge doors
# wow said Franklin it's big
# it has to be said Beaver there are real dinosaurs in there
# do you remember in New York we went with grandma and grandpa to the museum with the dinosaurs
# yeah that's called the museum of natural history in New_York
# Beaver had been to the museum before she knew everything about it
# big dinosaurs she emphasized
# so big that they ate trees for breakfast
# Franklin was afraid to ask what dinosaurs ate for lunch
# Franklin sat down on the steps
# what's wrong asked Snail
# Beaver says there are real dinosaurs in the museum
# Snail looked alarmed
# that sounds scary
# and Franklin nodded
# we're not gonna get that
# in the museum lobby Mister_Owl went over the rules
# no shouting no running and stay with the group
# Mister_Owl said Beaver one more thing
# watch out for the dinosaurs
# Moose and Bear laughed
# but Franklin didn't he moved a little closer to Mister_Owl
# their first stop was the bat cave
# it was dark inside
# squeaks and squawks filled the air
# what's that asked Franklin
# Beaver giggled
# that's the sound bats make to find their way around
# Franklin was relieved that it was bats and not dinosaurs
# the class visited the rainforest next
# Franklin climbed high into a tree house
# he could see the tops of trees
# can you spot any dinosaurs asked Snail
# Franklin shook his head and climbed down quickly
# there was so much to do in the museum that Franklin almost forgot about the dinosaurs
# in the medieval room Franklin had fun dressing up like a knight
# yeah
# Franklin even got_to dig in a sandy pit
# he was the first one to find an arrow head
# it was just like being a real archaeologist
# wow that's neat
# an archaeologist is when you dig in the sand for very old things
# yeah
# the best part is still to come said Beaver as they sat down in the cafeteria
# yes agreed Bear lunch
# Mister_Owl smiled I think Beaver means the dinosaur exhibit
# Franklin gulped I'm too tired to see more I think I'll stay here a while he muttered
# me too said Snail
# you'll forget about being tired when you see the dinosaurs said Mister_Owl
# eat up and let's go
# reluctantly Franklin and Snail followed the giant footprints down a long leafy corridor
# there was a loud roar
# the floor shook and so did Franklin
# ah
# screamed Franklin when he turned the corner
# he was looking right into the bony mouth of a tyrannosaurus
# Franklin blinked
# they're bones
# real dinosaur bones
# but the dinosaurs aren't even alive
# alive giggled Beaver of course not
# there hasn't been a live dinosaur for millions of years
# you sure make good jokes Franklin
# you sure do said Snail
# as they were leaving Franklin and his friends walked past the egyp
# the egyptian exhibit
# next time said Beaver you should visit the tomb there's a mummy inside
# is it real asked Franklin
# yeah and it's scary said Beaver
# but Franklin wasn't scared
# he had a mummy at home

# next to the tv where it belongs
# phew that was hard work

# &
# &
# &
# okay Franklin rides a bike
# Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run
# he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swings
# but Franklin had a problem
# what was Franklin's problem
# right
# he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels right
# right
# in the spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes
# Beaver was the brave one
# she took her extra wheels off first
# she practiced and practiced and then went to the park to show off
# look at me she said I can ride my bike all by myself
# Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles
# who's that
# Rabbit and who's that
# Bear
# right
# it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other
# soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels
# we're going on a picnic said Bear come on
# Franklin was worried that his friends would make fun of his training wheels
# so he lied and said I'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone
# &
# poor Franklin
# what's Franklin doing in this picture
# what's he doing here
# what's he doing there
# Sweetie
# is he on the slide
# he's on the swing you're right
# afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike
# he wanted to ride all by himself
# he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
# Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and fell into the flower bed
# I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
# &
# poor Franklin
# for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out
# he watched as his friends rode off without him
# they were becoming great explorers on their bikes
# what are they doing
# they're getting ice cream cones
# what kind of ice cream are they eating
# you don't know
# whaddya think
# what's your favorite kind of ice cream
# really
# do you like vanilla
# you like chocolate ice cream
# mm
# in an ice cream cone that sounds great
# you like strawberry too
# mm what color is strawberry ice cream
# orange I think strawberry ice cream is pink
# see
# see I think maybe that's strawberry
# that's strawberry right
# yeah I don't have any though
# I'm sorry to say
# maybe we can go later to get ice cream whaddya think
# kay
# on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house
# that looks like fun said Franklin's mother
# I can't ride without my training wheels groaned Franklin
# &
# did you give it your best effort asked his mother
# well said Franklin
# hm let's see
# it looks like some little schmutz maybe from your granola bar
# maybe it's your sticky granola bar
# well
# your granola bar has a raspberry center so maybe that's what it was
# what Sweetie
# you wanna sip
# yes
# ah
# that is delicious
# that tastes delicious right
# strawberry water
# you're silly
# you gave me a kiss on the head
# you know what
# I love you
# I love your kisses
# I see you little blankie girl
# I see you
# there you are
# are you hiding
# yes
# yes I can
# well said Franklin maybe I can try one more time
# Franklin sat on his bike it's tippy he said
# his mother held on to the seat
# try it I won't let you go until you tell me to
# Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bike from behind
# he felt unsteady and very unsure
# I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling
# riding a bike is difficult said his mother
# but you can't give up just because it's frustrating
# it's too hard for me said Franklin
# it was easy for my friends
# do you think everything comes easy for them she asked
# Franklin had to think about that
# that's a little mouse what's he doing
# oh you're right he is riding his bicycle
# Franklin went to the park
# he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars
# each time she got_to the third rung she fell into the sand below
# no Beaver said Bear do it like this it's easy
# easy for you said Beaver she tried once more and fell again
# maybe tomorrow she grumbled
# Franklin remembered when Badger learned to swim
# she was afraid to put her head underwater
# it's easy said Franklin just do it
# Badger sputtered and cried
# it took her a long time to feel good in the water
# now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other
# where is Snail
# I don't think Snail is in this book
# Snail's in the other book

# Franklin thought about the first time Fox played baseball
# he couldn't hit the ball at all
# but he tried and tried until one day Fox got a home run
# who's at
# Porcupine
# just then Porcupine came by
# she moved very slowly
# she pointed to the pads on her knees wrists and elbows
# they make me feel funny she said but they keep me safe
# that's it cried Franklin and hurried home
# oh I think Porcupine's nice now
# don't you think Porcupine's nice
# the bear
# why think the bear's mean
# uhuh
# no the bear's Franklin's friend
# they're all nice animals

# is he on the swing
# he's in the sandbox wow neat
# that's great
# that's good pretending
# Franklin put on padding
# he lined the walk with old pillows
# I'm ready to try again Franklin told his mother
# now I won't worry if I fall
# Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat
# Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and fell many times but he never gave up
# then it happened
# Franklin told his mother to let go
# he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash
# way to go cheered his mother
# careful Honey
# Franklin was thrilled
# finally he was riding his bike all by himself
# I can do it he shouted and rode to the park to show his friends
# look at me he called
# Franklin tried to signal with one hand like Beaver but he toppled over
# I think I'll work on that he laughed
# not everything is as easy at it looks
