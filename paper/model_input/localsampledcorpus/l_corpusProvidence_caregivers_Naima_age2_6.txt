# let's brush your teeth now Naima
# why do they what
# well so they don't run into the land and break the ship that's why
# why because ships are for the ocean they're just for floating in the water they don't come on land
# and sometimes if they hit the land they can break
# and water can get on the ship and it could sink so they want to stay away from the land
# and when it's foggy they can't see the land
# and if they can't see the land they don't know where it is that's why fog horns help them fog horns help them know where the land is
# come sit here little ship
# so when it's really foggy all they have_to do is listen
# and when they listen they can hear the fog horn and that tells them oh there's land there we better stay away
# so whenever they hear it
# can you face me so I can brush your teeth
# they know to stay away
# are you a ship
# oh you better listen for fog horns then
# oh boy
# can you face Mommy so I can brush your teeth
# Daddy is a fog horn
# Daddy what's today's date is it the twenty first
# yes it is the twenty first
# it's August twenty first two thousand and three
# we're on vacation
# why are we on vacation Naima
# to spend the time at Maine

# you wanna do that one

# let's see let's read what it is
# this is called the side stretch not a very Sanskrit name
# the side stretch
# stand with your legs wide apart
# actually you probably shouldn't do it on the here on the you should do it over there
# right in front of your right here right here
# right in front of your &-uh yeah that's it
# stand with your legs wide apart
# put your legs wide apart really wide really wide really wide that's it good
# that's good no that's too wide
# there that's good
# take a deep breath in and stretch your arms out at the sides like this just like that yeah
# like that that's good
# actually we didn't finish it Naima
# stretch your legs put your legs wide apart that's it
# further further more more more good
# arms out like this and then
# you turn your feet towards the right side and that one too
# that one too
# both no both feet pointing that way
# that one too
# pointing this way
# like that yep
# and then you bend you stretch and you bend like that
# that's how you do it
# you wanna read a good library book tonight
# which one
# okay
# oh my gosh Naima we're not gonna read ten books tonight

# oh boy I like that one alright
# I know you like flaps a lot

# right can I put this on your lap
# we'll look at the book whoops
# I guess not okay there we go right there
# whoa
# I love you too
# you're a sweet little mommy
# I didn't know you were a little mommy
# swikka dikka dameek
# a swikka dikka dameek
# oh
# you're a sweet Naima
# you're getting warm are you cold
# we should put some pajamas on you
# it's almost time for sleep whoa clunk sleep time
# your nursie drops you off at the Nurney's house
# oh_my_goodness
# I never heard of such a thing
# I never heard of such a thing
# do you wanna wear your blue and yellow pajamas or your pink and orange pajamas
# I don't know about any pajamas
# nursie pajamas
# hm
# &
# thank you should I put them back in my shirt
# okay they're back in my shirt now
# computer nursies
# what are computer nursies
# what
# are you being silly Miss silly
# shall we get pajamas now
# you want the pink ones or the blue ones
# I don't know about any nursie pajamas
# you want a nursing shirt
# Mommy is the one who wears nursing shirts
# not Naima
# you don't have any nursing shirts
# well I'll get the pink and orange nursing shirt
# what d'ya mean no
# you know what we never combed your hair after your bath
# and we should put hair elastics in shouldn't we
# oh okay I see there's a theme here
# I think maybe it's time to stop taping
# the seam
# oh the theme
# do you know what a theme is
# a theme is kind of like an idea
# and I said there's a theme here
# and the theme was that you were talking about nursing a lot
# oh in the drug store at the
# or whatever
# I'm sorry Naima what were you saying
# because Mister Fixit fixed it
# but he's a funny guy Mister Fixit he fixes things in funny ways
# I think he was supposed to fix it so that it would say Mama again two hands please
# oh
# but instead he fixed it and now it says Dada
# funny Mister Fixit
# &-um
# you're having some of this too right
# I don't know
# yes
# careful with the glass
# olive oil
# humor me
# I just need something and I don't have butter
# oh the plate
# almond butter is healthy
# yeah I'm gonna put that on
# salmon
# why did
# I'm sorry Naima I wasn't paying attention to you
# oh he does
# but it's kinda mysterious they don't say why
# they don't say what he does it actually sounds not only mysterious it sounds ominous
# Naima please don't wipe your hands on the table like that
# I don't want you to do that are you gonna eat some egg white and egg yolk
# yes
# so that Sam can play with it
# it's a toy boat isn't it
# is it a toy boat
# no it's a big boat somebody's in it while he's fixing it
# oh
# so that it won't sink
# if a boat has a leak it might sink
# it might go to the bottom
# 0it might go to the bottom of the ocean
# I guess Philip's wagon was broken
# maybe the wheel was broken
# Mister Fixit likes to fix everything he touches practically
# because I think he must have been using the wrong
# he must have been using the wrong directions
# when he was fixing it
# he was supposed to fix it so it said Mama
# but instead he fixed it so it said Dada
# I think he probably was
# like sometimes you need directions to fix things you need to read from a paper with directions
# hm
# like Babaji fixed his refrigerator
# his refrigerator wasn't making any ice
# and he fixed it
# he had to read the directions for how to fix it
# and then he fixed it
# hm and hm
# remember what was I reading oh remember when I was trying to try out the backpack to carry you in
# I had to read the directions
# directions explain how to use something or how to fix something
# mhm
# when it first came when we first took it out of the box
# be careful don't spill that drink okay
# more
# a smoothie is a drink
# yeah I would eat more toast
# I would basically eat toast until toast stops coming my way
# do you want some help getting that out
# you're trying to frost it
# why don't I help you
# mm egg yolk yum yum yum
# it's still a little bit foggy out there Naima
# did you hear the weather
# I didn't
# I mean yesterday it was overcast much of the morning and then it burned off
# it was spectacular
# a spectacular turnaround
# I wonder if fog is a mosquito deterrent
# hm
# wishful thinking
# I don't think so
# mosquitos repelled by fog
# could be the cool temperatures associated with it
# hm
# 0i wonder if there's hot fog and cold fog
# there are probably many different kinds of fog
# but we don't know them
# we would probably have fifty words for fog if we lived in Maine
# and warm fog
# and warm fog
# yes
# probably there's warm fog too
# well you know there's a certain appeal to even though it's foggy at the moment
# to
# taking a day like this to go to Eastport
# because
# mhm no I was gonna suggest the same
# it's sort of the urban entertainment
# all three blocks of it
# well I think Lubbeck is becoming the more sophisticated
# I don't know about that
# urban renewal spot
# The Home_Port restaurant and summer keys
# Naima eat please don't please don't play with that
# the kids in the
# those things have been those things have both been here a long time it's not becoming
# oh yeah
# with your fingers
# with your fingers sometimes you do that sometimes you can do that 0do you wanna knife or do you wanna
# or you wanna
# oh you already did it I think
# okay
# why'ncha eat some
# you can cut one piece and then I want you to eat it
# mm
# is it really shorter to go on the ferries
# oh it in terms of amount of time no it's probably shorter to go the other way cause I think if you drive to Eastport it's probably about an hour
# from here
# yeah
# it's just it's more interesting and more broken up but you know if you go by ferry I mean if it's say fifteen minutes for the ferry each ferry that's half an hour of a wait plus each one is about twenty five minutes that's an hour and a half plus the drive time so
# it's probably longer to go that way
# not that it'll be very spectacular that is really one of the Eastport to Deer Island ferry is just one of those local ferries
# well the thing is if we drove there and then took the ferry back by then it might not
# oh good idea
# babe
# we could get mustard
# oh dear hm
# you know we still have oh
# 0are you talking to Dad I'm sorry
# it's not properly calibrated
# that's alright I'll I'll
# I haven't calibrated my slice thickness
# yes baby
# what is it
# say that again
# oh what mosquitos the fog might do
# I don't quite understand the question but I think you're saying
# I think that's what you're asking
# hm
# cause I said maybe that's
# well Mommy thought maybe mosquitos don't like fog so that the fog will keep them away
# Mommy was more hoping that than thinking that
# I think Mommy was engaging in something called wishful thinking
# yes
# that's called wishful thinking that's when you wish something's true
# even if it's not
# I don't think toddlers are supposed to have that level of reasoning yet
# because toddlers are toddlers what are you doing
# hey what are you doing with the
# d'ya want more
# smoothie Boobaloo
# you can have more smoothie if you want
# does Miss Boo want more smoothie
# good good
# that's a good smoothie isn't it Naima
# and you have lots_of egg and egg white Daddy might eat some
# Daddy's gonna eat some mm
# oh that's for Daddy too
# are you gonna feed me
# mm
# good
# 0are you taking turns eating with Daddy
# yes I did Naima
# mm I'm chewing it and I'm swallowing it
# and I'm washing it down
# just like Naima does
# I don't want egg yolk thank you Naima you should eat it
# you can have egg yolk
# you should eat it
# it's good but it's for you
# yeah I'll eat the egg white
# mm I like egg white
# 0do you like feeding Daddy
# &-um it's a little too close to the edge
# mm Daddy likes egg yolk really a lot
# it has protein in it
# that's the dirty little secret about egg whites
# you did thank you
# right to Daddy
# oh that one
# okay thank you
# a crumb of egg yolk not a piece of egg yolk
# now your turn
# no it's your turn &
# I want you to eat it a little bit more now
# Daddy's gonna watch
# I am
# cause I like protein it's healthy for me
# I think the other thing is
# are you done Boo_Boo
# yes
# oh I heard a burp
# why'ncha finish the smoothie that's in the glass
# the placement of words in question formation
# oh
# mm that was good thank you
# okay I believe you
# thank you
# it's moothie the smoothie is moothie
# let's take let's take your bib off and then let's clean you up
# it's moothie
# mhm
# oh I see some egg white right there and I see some almond butter on your pants
# I saw that
# he was eating it right from your hand
# you were offering it to him with your hand
# I'm gonna wipe off your hands a little
# tweet tweet
# what kinda bird are you
# oh
# mhm
# they do I haven't seen a robin in a while
# are you a grown up robin or a toddler robin or a baby robin
# oh are you a robin chick
# hi robin chick
# mhm
# why
# oh Daddy does have a brown cereal I gotta switch over to that I think
# mm
# for medicinal purposes
# yes wash why don't you wash your hands at the sink now too okay
# oh you want Daddy to clean I thought Mommy just did Mommy just cleaned you up like a baby do you want Daddy to clean you up
# I think I just cleaned you up like a baby but I think your hands still have some residue on them
# well shall we go wash your hands then
# oh Naima you
# 0do 0you wanna try again or 0do you want me to try it for you
# today is Thursday August

# look at that
# what does sclaiming mean
# it's sclaiming
# I guess you do but I don't

# that's what sclaiming means
# you mean when the legos click together
# hm
# d'you want me to hold that

# it might fall over though
# oh a present for him
# are you going to give it to him

# you want something to put the tree on
# whoop
# I thin
# woo
# that's because that's in the way
# here
# okay
# yeah
# mm
# you know I think we need to stabilize it
# like that
# you can put things on there
# there
# and I bet this would also stabilize it if we put this right here
# then it won't fall so easily
# you wanna put it on top of this
# okay
# mm
# he's gonna be so happy
# it's so nice when someone gives you a present
# sometimes people give presents on birthdays
# mm look Sleepy Naima made you a present
# you're gonna what it
# is that another new word
# what does that mean
# babilize
# oh you mean stabilize it
# look Sleepy Naima made you a tower
# this blackberry bush
# oh
# oh yep that's a good idea
# yeah you could put that one up there
# whoa woopsie_daisy
# you know what
# we can put it back together
# how about if we made one that was a little more stable and it wouldn't fall down as easily
# wait a m
# let's make it taller
# we can still make it tall
# mm oh
# oh that's a nice
# you could put it right on top of that one
# yeah
# it
# it'll go there
# they can't really go next to each other
# I think you have_to put it on top
# for it to fit
# what a nice tree
# it looks just like a tree
# is it a tree tower
# you could make another tree
# it's gonna what
# butter mill
# hm
# what what does butter milling mean
# what does bweeleelee mean
# bweeleelee
# bweeleelee
# bweeleelee
# Sleepy Bear wants to know what that means
# bweeleelee
# he used to say those things when he
# oh those were the baby words he used
# oh you're using those words
# mm
# is he saying thank you
# mm
# he is
# when you're first making it
# and then will you say you're welcome Sleepy Bear
# want me to stabilize it
# is that what Sleepy Bear's saying
# 0it looks like he's looking at it and he likes it
# do we have any more like those
# pajama pajama pajama
# this tower has a snail on it
# hey what are you doing there
# bring that back
# you were trying 0to take it off
# why
# excuse me
# Naima you took off
# you took the
# socket
# why did you do that
# okay
# you don't know why you did
# you want some breakfast
# do you wanna eat pancakes
# blueberry pancakes
# with blueberries inside them
# I think we have little
# oh really
# I didn't realize that
# it looked to me yesterday like we had a fair bit
# no but
# you mean not enough for pancakes for breakfast
# yeah for
# oh well Naima could have just pancakes with the blueberries in them and eat them like muffins
# the ones that are from yesterday
# that are in the fridge
# do you want to have some yogurt
# would you like some kiwi
# the Stitchta_Bear is loofing
# what does that mean
# he's what
# pajumming
# you hit the ball and the panda bear throws it to Sleepy Bear
# and what's that called
# budging up
# he's budging up
# he's watching what
# he pinches his mommy
# he's pinching you I see that now
# you could say
# if you're his mommy you could say don't pinch me Sleepy Bear that doesn't feel good
# you have_to teach him Naima
# 'cause if he's a toddler bear he needs to learn what the rules are and how to be with people like you don't pinch people and you don't hit people
# you don't hurt people
# what're you gonna tell him
# right you still can say it in a nice way but he still needs to learn
# oh no
# you don't wanna hurt your bear
# sounds like the b
# across the border crossing from &-um
# Saint Stephen is gotten very slowed down
# did you read this article
# no
# it's
# they're not saying that but they're implying it 'cause they're talking about new projects for upgrading border crossings
# frustrating to passengers
# I bet since
# 'cause we
# when did we cross there
# was it after nine eleven
# it wasn't it was before
# yeah
# I have a feeling it's really
# slowed down
# the bear's in the chair
# are you in the chair
# 0are you sitting with your bear in the chair
# let's have the kiwi
# did you say you wanted some
# well let's go find it
# mm
# well I'm gonna carry my tea and I'm gonna carry
# the backpack and
# do you wanna sit here at this table Naima
# I think maybe I'll clear off this table and we can all sit and have breakfast at this table which is a little more comfortable
# you're stabilizing those towers
# it does
# okay
# I'm thinking I would like to
# splurge and get a really nice
# and and like
# well actually
# I mean family all family
# oh
# have some kind of a
# oh a very you mean
# like for the whole time even
# well for the whole
# whatever
# yeah
# but but certainly like pick a weekend and say y'know we're gonna have a dinner party or a cookout
# oh okay
# or something
# well to come this far up most people will wanna spend more than a weekend
# sure
# but and we'll need like less of advance
# well for instance here's a sleeps ten
# mhm
# six bathrooms
# mhm
# four king beds
# where's that
# &-uh Alice Head
# ocean front
# oh Alice Head
# oh
# I I recognize myself in that
# is that
# I do too
# yeah
# maybe Daddy can help you
# may I help you Boo
# okay can Daddy sit with you while you do it
# yeah you need something to stabilize it
# steak
# you mean steak like what the bear eats in that book that kind of steak
# hm
# yeah well this is one of 'em
# that I had in mind
# what
# I said this
# well there are a number that are huge like that I mean
# for rent I don't know
# yeah no I've seen sleeps
# you can get sleeps eight sleeps ten
# pretty easily but it doesn't mean they're
# it's actually it's actually sumptuous accommodations
# you're looking through Great Houses For A Family Vacation that's you your children and your friends each have their own
# I thought Daddy said he was gonna sit with you
# well I was refused
# oh that's right
# can I sit with you Boo and help
# what do you want me to do
# can I help
# if I hold it
# okay
# can I make a suggestion
# you don't wanna hear my idea
# alright then I won't tell you my idea
# you know you know why
# you don't need to hear what you think
# what what I think about it
# because things are more stable if they're not on just one lego
# see how this is wider
# if you put the wider legos on the bottom it'll be more stable
# see this is wider
# if you put the narrow towers on top of the wider towers it'll be more stable
# yeah even that is better
# that if I were you I'd put that on the bottom
# 'cause that's really stable that's like a platform
# it's a pretty big tower though
# and you're doing a good job by holding onto it with one hand that also helps
# to keep it more stable
# shall we have a civilized breakfast together
# that would be nice
# what do you think Naima Boo
# do you wanna have breakfast together
# &
# I thought you wanted kiwi
# kiwi is delicious
# let's put the
# she needs to pung it back Daddy
# yes
# oh you want me back here
# okay
# how 'bout if we stabilize it by putting it on that
# it'll help
# you don't think so
# I'm stabilizing it
# alright alright
# you hold it
# you know to make something more stable it will help if you
# &
# see
# put the wider ones on the bottom and the narrow ones on the top
# there
# see it's more stable look at how stable that is now
# and the other thing is it's hard to make things stable on
# 'cause it's sort of uneven
# things would be more stable on that floor which is much more flat
# see this is an uneven floor
# well I meant this kind of
# this part of the floor in the kitchen is more stable
# we'll put this up here
# what's who gonna try and do
# I'm gonna
# mm
# oh
# it's very uns
# oh that's pretty good but
# hey that's pretty good
# hey
# you wanna show Mommy
# hey Mommy
# oh I see that's a really tall tower
# &
# yay
# I think that when you put it on the kitchen floor and moved it from the carpet it helped a lot
# she's making these as presents for Sleepy Bear
# oh boy
# he's a lucky bear
# here's some kiwi
# mhm
# &-um do you want to &-uh
# I I'm happy to make a run and get some maple syrup 'cause it they have some
# I wasn't going to suggest
# I know but
# well I don't
# I mean there's toast and there's jam I don't
# can you can you bring this over and give it to her and and try to wave it in front of her face or something
# 0will you have some kiwi Boo
# Daddy's gonna eat some have some
# it's yummy
# mm
# oh you're right there's hardly any syrup
# do we have a syrup mouse in the house
# we do
# I've been using it in my cereal when I have cereal
# oh oh that's what
# I use it
# allegedly
# well I think it's enough for us to split that last pancake that was
# oh oh we could
# and then we can have toast also
# I mean since we're
# we only have
# two more mornings here I wouldn't really be in favor of buying a whole maple syrup just for that 'cause I don't want to have_to carry back a lot of
# okay
# half used food things
# mhm
# mm I think Naima likes kiwi Mommy
# oh the chair is there
# her special puffin
# hey do you wanna sit up here and eat
# sit properly
# you have your puffin place mat that you like
# did you hear a fog horn
# oh yeah okay
# do you remember that noise we heard last time
# I mean at Head it was a grunting noise
# Daddy said it was a fog horn but Mommy said she didn't think so
# okay
# whee this Baby_oh
# oh I didn't realize we're
# the tape is running
# yeah
# okay this is just barely warm but
# Naima do you want some pancake too
# does
# she doesn't have a mic does she
# yeah
# it's right here
# oh
# well doesn't it taste a little bit like muffin
# it's like a blueberry muffin that's what I thought
# is it also like a muffin shape
# hm
# mm
# that looks pretty yummy
# you wanna split this with me
# &-uh sure
# if there's enough
# I think there's enough syrup for this
# ridiculous
# hm

# &-uh soy milk would be excellent
# hey Miss Naima Boo
# can have breakfast
# with you with you Boo
# and I'll put some toast in too
# I don't want toast I might have something else
# cereal
# Daddy doesn't want some
# why
# well I don't think I need cereal but I'm thinking I might like to have some cereal
# 'cause I like my cereal
# t's a good question
# it's
# I like eating cereal in the morning
# just one end
# how 'bout the other end
# mm
# what are we gonna do today Miss Naima
# are we gonna go hiking
# mhm
# you wanna go looking for
# so do I
# I wanna go to
# Cobb's Cook
# mhm
# yes I saw the fly
# and we might see
# mhm that would be fun
# I don't think there are any bears
# except Naima Bear
# Naima Betsy Bear
# Bitsy you're right
# I forgot
# is it good
# it's all gone I'm sorry
# that was just one kiwi and you ate it
# and there's no more
# you could have
# you could have
# blue
# blueberries
# okay
# mm
# is that your blueberry song
# mhm
# &-um which blueberries are the
# there's
# well there's some in the box the organic ones
# yeah in this bowl
# well that's the ones washed left over that aren't organic but you could give those to her I guess
# they're not sprayed so
# I'm gonna go fiddle with the laundry
# there's your yogurt
# I did knock it over I'm sorry
# you can fix it after breakfast
# there's some stems in here Baby_oh so we can get rid of the stems if you like
# and that green one you don't want to eat though
# that's not ripe
# but you can eat the rest
# mhm well all you really need to do is take the stems off
# you pinch the stems off like that
# and then you can eat the berries
# and that way you have more berries to eat
# you don't want to throw away the berries
# oh you don't want to throw away good berries when you could eat them
# that would be a waste of good blueberries
# especially these blueberries which are delicious
# we should &-uh
# I wonder if a little boy or a little girl picked these blueberries
# hm I think it was a little boy who put them out
# I saw a little boy putting them out
# uhoh
# we bought them on the road Naima
# when we went to Machaias
# oh you wanna look yourself
# okay
# Daddy will
# hm this has not been
# refrigerated
# what's that
# this blueberry jam has not been refrigerated
# 0it should be okay
# I guess but I'm gonna put it in the fridge now
# &-um what was I thinking
# oh we should &-um
# we should try to visit the organic blueberry farm down the road
# is it on
# it is on the way to Cobb's Cook isn't it
# &-uh no
# or is it
# no
# it's on the way to Machaias
# oh that's right
# because otherwise we should call Gramps'
# and give them a little heads
# if we're gonna do that
# maybe we should
# I think we should call Gramps'
# it's a working day Tuesday
# yeah
# so
# the only issues are whether Grandma's going on a cross
# I wonder if he's
# well and I wonder if they're at the Blue Hill Fair
# oh
# marketing or anything
# I suppose so
# we can give 'em a call
# which starts tonight actually as far as I can tell
# well
# so
# well if the weather's as good maybe we should take the trip
# the proble
# Sunday
# to
# Blue Hill Fair from
# oh y'know it would make a lot more sense to get the blueberries except we'll have_to buy
# keep buying ice
# from
# and pick it up there
# no I really would prefer Tuesday
# but
# 'cause Gramps' Farm is out of the way
# but we're not
# I know
# compared to Blue Hill
# I mean
# well they're both
# I mean
# Gramps' Farm is less out of the way than the Blue Hill Fair is
# &-uh yeah but I think that trip to the Blue Hill Fair would be &-uh
# right
# good for other reasons
# right but I'm just saying in terms of
# and icebox versus taking the side trip to Gramps' Farm on the way home I'd prefer to take the side trip to Gramps' Farm
# oh it's not the
# yeah well it does
# it's still a problem in terms of the timing of the trip
# why
# 'cause we're gonna be under a lot of pressure to get
# I know but
# yeah
# from Skudick
# is that a reasonable stop
# that's a very reasonable stop in fact it's almost an ideal stop it's about an hour and a half
# okay well
# actually maybe not
# maybe an hour but still
# is that a good breakfast Naima
# yeah
# how is that jam
# I haven't had any
# it's good
# very blueberry_y
# not overly sweet
# we could read that after breakfast
# well I'm not gonna read it 'cause I'm eating my breakfast
# and I'm gonna eat some cereal now so I
# I'm not gonna read it
# we'll read it to you as s
# really soon as soon as we finish breakfast
# you wanna talk about what's in that book
# yeah
# Sal and her mother take some pails
# why do they want to
# why does the moth
# her mother want to pick blueberries
# that's right
# her mother wants to can blueberries for next winter
# that means
# I know it probably sounds like it means put them in cans but it means put them in jars
# like to make jam
# yeah
# on the stove and put it in jars and then store it keep it so that they will have blueberries all year round
# we do that too except we put the blueberries in the freezer
# so we have them all year round
# almost all year round
# so Naima gets to eat frozen blueberries
# all year round
# this is the time of year when people who have blueberry fields pick their blueberries
# in fact that's probably a reason why they aren't at the Blue Hill Fair because 'cause it's probably peak time for picking
# yeah
# or maybe
# oh little Sal finds mother crow and her children
# little bear finds a mother partridge I think you're right
# there are a lot of mothers and children in that book don't you think
# mother
# Sal's mother and Sal
# the mother bear and little bear
# and the mother partridge and the mother crow
# and their children
# I think that's all
# who else
# Little Bear are you eating your blueberries
# gesundheit
# gesundheit gesundheit
# for two sneezes
# oop
# you need your spoon
# I'll wash it
# kiwi seeds
# &-um y'know I could take her cottage garden this morning if you wanna have a little reading morning for yourself and then we could do
# yeah that's
# we could do Cobb's Cook in the afternoon
# I just wanna take a shower before I go out but
# you wanna go on a hike this morning Naima
# you wanna go on a hike with Mommy
# and look at flowers and things like that
# doesn't that sound like fun
# hm
# sour yogurt
# are you gonna eat some
# all that
# mhm
# oop
# I think you dropped some blueberries out of the spoon
# can you pick up the ones that're on the mat now and put them
# Naima you know what you're doing now
# you're making a mess
# I'd like you to pick up the blueberries which are perfectly good to eat over here and either eat them or put them in your yogurt
# and that goes for these over here too
# these ones
# pick them up and put them in the yogurt or eat them okay
# good
# there's some more though
# over here
# this is just some diapers that are on a rinse cycle I think when they're done when they start spinning I'm gonna jump in the shower
# mhm
# take a shower
# thank you for cleaning up those blueberries now you can eat them
# in fact
# are you going a
# for a hike with Mommy
# to the to the cottage garden
# yeah that's where we're gonna do our hiking
# we can be bears
# in the woods
# I wonder if I should bring the
# huh
# it's a little hard to do it if
# just one person
# you would like to hike on your own just walking wouldn't you
# and if you wear sneakers then you'll have more traction and you won't slip
# mm
# like you did yesterday
# when we were hiking and you had sandals on
# remember
# that was a nice hike we did
# is something in your mouth
# blueberry skin
# mm I like that honey
# oh is that the first time you're having the honey
# no but I like
# oh but it is nice it has a nice flavor
# 0remember where we used to get crystallized honey all the time
# I also like the texture 'cause it's semi_crystallized
# mhm
# yep
# 0it 0would be nice to &-uh
# 0it 0would be nice to maybe bring back home some blueberry honey
# you can't really get it on the Cape
# mm
# we could maybe get a bigger thing or
# I think I got that in Eastport
# in Eastport
# yeah
# but there must be
# y'know
# 0it must be all over
# what did you say Naima about Blueberries For Sal
# oh
# kaplink kaplank kerplunk
# what's that
# mhm
# then there was mother bear and little bear walking along
# they were munching
# munching berries and swallowing them
# getting fat for the winter
# 'cause bears sleep the whole winter
# did you know that
# they sleep the whole winter
# and so they need to eat a lot of food before they go to sleep just like you need to eat a lot of
# mm
# bears sleep all winter
# they sleep for days and days and
# they sleep all winter because
# they get tired
# that's a good question
# well 'cause they're tired I guess
# 'cause they
# they don't like to waste any time
# they sleep
# that's a good question
# I think because she heard him outside when he was going
# and that
# she was lying in bed
# when she heard that sound outside her window
# so she realized that she'd better do something or else she's not gonna sleep all night 'cause she'll be listening to the bear going
# that bear had a bad toothache
# I guess he didn't brush his teeth regularly
# that's why
# so she invited him in 'cause she wanted to help him so that he wouldn't have a toothache so he wouldn't be making so much noise all night so she could go to sleep
# I think that's really why she helped him
# and maybe she helped him because she didn't like hearing him suffer and be so miserable
# maybe she wanted to make him feel better just so he would feel better
# well you know like Daddy said you could pinch the stem off like that and then you could eat the berry
# yes
# did y
# are you eating yogurt too or just blueberries
# yogu
# I haven't seen you eat any yogurt
# 'cause
# you have
# okay
# whatever you say
# why don't you take another bite of yogurt
# &
# please
# please
# oh okay
# Harbour
# &-uh yeah Casko Bay doesn't
# oh it's appealing to me
# really
# well it's a closed privacy
# yes Boo
# I think the tooth was aching 'cause maybe he had cavity and maybe he didn't brush his teeth regularly
# maybe he ate too much honey
# maybe the bear ate
# hey Naima
# Naima
# I said
# yeah you know you're not supposed to do that
# you're making a mess
# you're playing with blueberries and squishing them and making a mess
# and
# y'know as you get a little bit older you're gonna have_to start cleaning up you own mess
# and then you'll be busy
# you'll be very busy
# unless you be
# unless you're a little neater
# you'll be very busy
# Naima is be a busy girl
# you're gonna be cleaning up your mess all day long
# no
# the bear drinks out of a big glass
# does he drink out of a big glass
# I didn't see that
# oh you mean if he had cavities
# well I think if he had cavities it was because he ate too much
# maybe too much honey
# too many
# oh maybe he ate too m
# too much salmon oh boy
# they do okay
# I didn't know that
# oh d'you think his mommy was giving him bear food like your mommy gives you bear food
# oh
# and too much salmon so he got cavities
# actually Naima I think it might have been from too much honey
# not too much salmon
# well because sweet things are a little worse for your teeth
# but actually blueberries might be okay
# I wouldn't be surprised if blueberries had things that are good for your teeth in them
# polyphenols
# polyphenols of various kinds
# flavonoids
# yeah
# in fact I'm sure someone's gonna have to look into the &-uh
# content of this new polyphenol
# in blueberries somebody needs to check whether blueberries have a lot of
# speaking of which there are blueberries on the floor
# oh
# blueberries on the floor Naima
# why are there blueberries on the floor Baby_oh
# oh there's blueberries
# Daddy's gonna get those blueberries
# maloo
# I see a lotta berries down here
# Daddy's pickin' 'em up 'cause I don't wanna make a mess on the floor
# blueberry stains are hard to clean
# oh you're arm's meeting Daddy
# very nice
# Daddy's gonna eat some of these they look so good
# mm mm mm mm
# I think there's only like probably a couple minutes left on the battery
# okay
# so
# can you turn it off and then
# are you gonna sleep Baby_oh
# are you sleepy
# you're in a bear cave
# is it cozy
# oh where are Grizzly and Sleepy
# oh there's Sleepy where's Griz
# Griz where are you
# that was funny the other day
# we couldn't find Griz and Sleepy and then Daddy just tripped over the chest and knocked it over and there they were
# 0they may have been inside all along
# Miss Naima you you
# say that again
# why did you want to go out with a bare bottom
# you mean outside
# I think 'cause maybe bugs would bite you on your bottom
# did you want bugs to bite your bottom
# you did
# I didn't know that
# why did you want bugs to bite your bottom
# 'cause it would feel good
# oh
# d'you think it feels good to have bugs bite you
# I didn't think so
# are you joking
# I think you're joking
# you're not joking
# you're not joking
# you're choking
# you're not joking you're choking
# oh my gosh
# I didn't realize you're choking
# what does that have_to do with anything
# Mom
# you joking choking baby

# I think Daddy might wanna curl up in that nest with you
# because the sun is coming down on that
# oh
# are you an earthworm
# mm
# oh you're a little snake
# snakes slide around and slither
# d'you know how to slither
# oh boy
# you should
# you should show Daddy I'd like to see you slither
# slithering snake
# okay Boo
# why don't we turn off the recorder and
# 'cause we're almost out of batteries anyway
# ooh we are out of batteries
# oh dear
# it is the morning of August twenty ninth two thousand and three
# August twenty ninth
# someone's waiting to have a tooth checked
# banana banana banana banana banana
# what d'you need
# it looks pretty stable
# at the moment
# just straightening up a little bit that's all
# oh you want some help
# yeah

# oh his mother says the pond might be cold
# I see
# a water bear
# want some help doing that
# there
# it's a cherry picker
# look at that panda
# well you know to be more stable you should go on the kitchen floor
# well I would move it to
# if I were making it stable I would move it to the kitchen floor 'cause that's more flat
# put it
# come put it on the kitchen floor and that will make it stable
# it's okay just keep going
# keep going
# you're fine
# I know
# well it's okay
# we'll fix it

# you did need a napkin
# so I will get you a napkin

# alrightie
# alrightie
# and would you like to have some salmon or some crab
# there's crab right there
# it's right there on your plate
# you would

# oh that's right
# bears do eat salmon
# in fact bears love salmon
# they do
# where's the salmon
# oh hey hey
# are you a bear zub
# here's some salmon little bear
# oh you're a king
# you changed your mind
# is that what you are telling me
# oh

# that's the color of the top of the salmon
# you can eat that too
# okay so my stuff is there

# and &-um
# that includes what I'm gonna wear tomorrow

# so everything else in the other bag
# everything else is in the other bag
# I zipped up my little section but there's plenty of room although all those are clean
# do you want anything &-uh
# washed
# tonight
# 'cause I I kinda want my jeans
# that's why I was gonna
# I don't need anything washed but if
# wash my jeans and my fleece
# did I leave stuff out on the grass there
# I might have
# the little bear doesn't like her salmon
# oh the king
# how 'bout if

# you wanna take that off
# okay Daddy will help
# yes that's a very nice bracelet
# it's a hair elastic bracelet
# well it's a bracelet nevertheless
# you turned it into a bracelet
# 'cause you wanted to
# is Mommy wearing a mic
# yes I'm wearing a mic
# oh
# yes I am
# I'm sure all that noise is really
# what
# I said I'm sure all that noise is really good
# well
# that's just how it goes I'm afraid
# so Miss Boo what else are you eating
# oh Mommy's cleaning up
# she's packing up some stuff
# oh
# is that a
# no it's your feet
# it's numbe
# numbe one and two onto the window
# oh
# one two one two one two
# is that number one two one two one two
# hey there's a fly in this place
# oh what're you doing
# are you gonna
# wave it away
# gonna scare it off
# &-uh y'know that's a bit of a challenge actually
# it's a challenge to
# 'cause flies don't
# they don't like to be herded very well
# they're not like sheep
# sheep you can
# but flies fly wherever they want
# is there a fly on your sippy cup
# no
# oh you're shooing the fly away
# good
# oh I don't think these flies bite
# I got a fly bite today though when we were out at the lighthouse
# that was a
# that was a very pesky Canadian fly and he bit me
# well
# I guess he was hungry
# I don't think he was just trying to be mean and nasty
# he was hungry
# speaking of being hungry Naima what else are you gonna eat
# you gonna eat some more penne pasta
# good
# I think Mommy put some crab salad there too
# there's crab
# you're a lucky king
# is it possible to know which clothes you're gonna wear tomorrow
# yes it is it's gonna be the black cords and the long sleeve black teeshirt
# belts
# actually I don't know if undies are in there
# well I packed
# yeah but you packed three
# who's in the dell
# the zipper in the dell
# the zipper in the dell
# hi ho the zippio
# that's good the zippio the zipper's in the dell
# that's pretty funny
# that's what the
# you did
# what did the rising tide say to Naima
# 'cause that tide was coming up higher higher and higher and higher
# because the tide was coming in
# the water was rising and the water was coming in
# and the water saw Naima and the water said I'm gonna get you
# 'cause the tide was rising
# the tide rises twice a day
# yeah
# twice a day
# that's two times
# why
# the moon pulls the water around
# 'cause the moon
# uhoh another
# is that
# it's probably that same pesky fly
# oh good idea
# shoo it away
# don't worry it's not a big deal Boo
# forget the fly
# it's just a fly
# it's just a fly
# we could open the door and it might fly out but in fact another fly might come in instead so
# yes Boo
# you think we should open the door
# yeah don't worry
# you want to thwack it
# oh dear
# oh dear
# I think that fly flew away
# oh I don't want to be a fly
# oh it's just kinda boring
# it's boring
# Naima you know what
# just forget the fly don't worry about it
# flies aren't that important
# they're just not very important
# &-uh it's not that you can shoo sheep
# I mean you can kind of guide sheep to go to a certain place like you could make sheep go out a certain door but you can't make a fly go out a certain door
# it's much harder
# it takes great skill to herd a fly
# why
# 'cause flies
# oh I got a fly bite because
# that was like
# &-uh I don't know what kind of fly that was
# it was a biting kind of a fly
# it was a Canadian kind of a biting fly
# those were the kind of flies Daddy used to get bit by all through the
# why am I Canadian
# 'cause that's where Babaji and Dadiji went
# they came from India
# they came from India and they went to Canada
# so Daddy's a Canadian
# &
# &
# what's &
# &
# oh
# cats do that don't they
# cats hiss
# that cat was hissing at when the bears came in and ate all the blueberries in that story
# when Bessie Ann
# no
# was it Bessie Ann
# Bessie Allen
# Bessie Allen and the dog and the cat came back into the house and the bears had gone the cat looked at her bowl and she
# just like that
# are you gonna eat some food my dear
# what
# I thought you were hungry
# would you like some salty cheese
# would you like some
# there's pasta right there
# I see plenty of pasta
# okay let's get you some salty cheese Booboo

# oh my gosh you need more tomato sauce
# why didn't Daddy think of that
# silly Daddy
# mm
# and that means we need a spoon
# I know but I need a spoon for the tomato sauce
# 'cause sauce is better spooned out than forked out
# 'cause it's more liquidy
# there what d'you say to that
# oh dear you need a spoon too
# why
# I thought you needed a fork
# you don't
# you gonna use your fingers
# mm mm
# wow already packed huh

# oh it just looked like sticky caramel
# no but
# it's not caramel though
# oh oh I see

# it's really good
# and actually I didn't get this and I forgot to find out what it's called
# told me but I forgot
# see it's not caramel at all
# what did I see that was sticky

# you mean the caramel
# what I'm talking to Mommy about

# his tree and Kanga says it's her tree
# which doesn't make any sense said Pooh
# because
# he had just come to the bridge
# and he was not looking where he was going
# well he was supposed to be going over a bridge I think but he was not looking where he was going
# don't know actually
# then he tripped over something and the fir cone jerked out of his paw into the river
# he tripped over something
# I don't think we know
# bother said Pooh as it floated under the bridge
# he looked at the river as it slipped slowly away beneath him
# and suddenly there was his fir cone slipping away too
# that's funny said Pooh
# I dropped it on the other side and it came out on this side
# I wonder if it would do it again
# and he went back for more fir cones
# it did
# it kept on doing it
# then he dropped two in at once and leaned over the bridge to see which of them would come out first
# and one of them did
# but as they were both the same size Pooh didn't know if it was the one he wanted to win or the other one
# so the next time he dropped in one big one and one little one
# the big one came out first
# which is what he had said it would do
# and the little one came out last which was what he had said it would do
# so he had won twice
# and when he went home for tea he had won thirty six and lost twenty eight
# which meant that he was
# well
# I guess twenty eight times he got it wrong and thirty six times he got it right
# which meant that he was
# well you take twenty eight from thirty six and that's what he was
# instead of the other way around

# hm oh that must be the hospital building
# that's what that is
# mm what's that
# where
# yeah
# and what's that
# here's it is kind of it's a helicopter that works like an ambulance it also brings people to the hospital but brings them in the air
# Gospal in the hospital
# last year I was Gospal the dog walker
# when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs
# and guess what I bought with the money they gave me
# a key chain with a little
# what
# race car yes
# what's this thing
# a ramp
# hm I thought it might be Gospal's shadow
# well it's it's got a little key chain with a race car attached to it
# yeah
# ramps don't have ears so it must be his shadow
# every one at school wanted it but it was mine
# I was scared that some one would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew a perfect place to hide it I put the key chain in my
# mouth oh oh
# what happens to him
# he does
# what do you think the teacher is trying to do
# what blue thing
# that's the bench that they're sitting on
# what do you think the teacher is trying to do
# because because he's sick
# he swallowed something
# oh dear
# the teacher called an ambulance
# there it is
# the ambulance people put me on a stretcher they asked me what happen but I still didn't want to tell
# oh see they don't know he swallowed his key chain
# they just know that he's very sick
# it was a little hard to explain why I put a key chain in my mouth
# I hope that you never do anything like that it'll be very bad for you they took me to the hospital what do you see in the hospital here
# mhm
# what do you think that is
# not the red thing see this white thing it's in the room
# that's the special water going into patient's body
# you had some special water going into your body when you were in the hospital remember
# okay what happens next I had a big room all to myself
# the nurse took off my scarf and put a white gown on me
# don't worry she said we'll take a good care of you it wouldn't hurt
# but I was still little scared specially when she took me to the x_ray room
# do you remember getting x_rays
# you might not remember you did get x_rays couple of times
# that's his x_ray and that shows the key chain right in his belly right there
# poor little guy ah
# the doctors asked him to count to ten of course I said
# can you count
# one
# two
# three
# I'm reading the story
# I fell sleep after counting to three and dreamed I was a race car driver
# they were right I didn't feel a thing when I woke up it was already night
# my parents were right there and Mom gave me a great big
# I think you're right
# inside was a race car so big I would never be able to swallow it
# that's the end of the story
# again
# yeah
# I think you might be finished on the potty there
# you do
# did you do more poop in there
# can I look
# you just want me to read the book more but I'll read the book more after you get off the potty
# oh boy
# maybe we should call Daddy and see if he's coming home
# well he wasn't stung by the yellow jackets and that's a good thing because he said he was allergic
# why don't we give Daddy a call
# you wanna take off that sticker
# that's the price sticker
# that's to tell people how much the book cost
# you need your hair elastic fixed
# well that you took off the whole sticker
# that's not a sticker that's the that's printed on the book
# hey do you wanna try to start ah making a new bedtime poster tonight
# we could do that
# yeah you took all the things off of it though so we need to make a new one that says what what we do at night time
# alright one more time and then I think you done on the potty
# I don't think you're peeing or pooping are you
# ah all this is is the title of the book Gospal in the hospital
# last summer I was Gospal the dog dog walker when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs
# and guess what I bought with the money they gave me
# did he buy dog food
# no did he buy did he buy a Chompo bar
# hm did he
# did he buy a tricycle
# oh a key chain with a little race car
# everyone at school wanted it but it was mine
# he's in school he's an animal who goes to school
# I was scared that someone would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew the perfect place to hide it I put the key
# but gulp oh no I swallowed it
# I think he did gulp it
# oh my god
# oh you think he chewed it
# oh maybe he did he definitely swelled though
# suddenly I felt very sick
# he really doesn't feel well
# what happened Gospal said the teacher but I didn't answer I was afraid to tell her about my key
# I think he's may be embarrassed
# well he wishes he hadn't swallowed the key
# she called an ambulance
# the ambulance put me on a stretcher
# this is the stretcher
# they asked me what happened but I still didn't want to tell
# it was a little hard to explain why I put a key
# well that's a good question I don't know I guess may be he thought the other children liked it very much
# they took me to the hospital oh those are the ambulance people
# see there he's on the stretcher they're carrying him in
# ah let see
# this is the special water
# it's a i_v fluid
# called i_v fluid it's also called special water it's something that goes for some people when they are in the hospital they need to get it
# that's a patient
# that's the patient's bed
# yes I think you're right
# the people who go to the hospital usually are sick
# mm
# I was a little scared that's what this page says
# they saw what I swallowed
# well it's no fun to be in the hospital
# they said you wouldn't feel a thing you'll be sleep they gonna go in and take the key
# I fell asleep after counting to three and dreamed I was a race car driver
# they were right I didn't feel a thing when I woke up it was already night
# my parents were right there what's that
# it's a great big package
# it could be a bath tub
# do you think it's a bath tub
# it could be an apple tree
# do you think it's an apple tree
# you're probably right
# it could be ten pairs of pants
# it was a race car
# what a nice present from his parents that's the end of the story
# and I think it's time

# where'r you gonna push Griz to on his very fun ride
# oh does Kawadee Head have a play
# oh 0the play
# oh I'm trying to remember which one that is
# oh I know where you mean
# the I know the bear walk one where we took your shoes off
# that was the Machias play
# school play
# yes we took your shoes off and it was a bear walk and it went up too
# it was like bear walking up a hill
# that was in Lubec that play
# okay
# meanwhile he's gonna find the doll
# oh boy does he know that or is it going to be a surprise
# oh Griz you're in for some fun that's such a great play
# the main where we heard the hurdy
# that was in Lubeck also
# that was at a little shop a little actually a little art gallery and there was a hurdy
# nice musical instrument
# you think Griz would like to listen to that music
# great
# oh
# I'm going to come back and listen after I make my tea I hear the water boiling
# mm
# the raccoon plays the hurdy
# wow
# I can't wait to hear it I'm gonna come listen in just a minute
# Naima we might go in a little while and bring shoes back to her
# well I think we will
# I'm not sure if we're gonna see her though that's the only thing
# 'cause she went somewhere to visit her cousins today
# and I don't know if she'll be back
# by the time we go
# I think we'll go in about a half an hour
# go and bring her shoes back
# 'cause I'm
# because I'm sure she'll want her shoes
# well they're her new shoes I don't think she's even worn them very much
# she went out in the boots that you borrowed
# I mean that you gave her
# those are her boots now
# 'cause they were too small for you you've got
# you've got bigger feet than she has
# oh they're not very small but they're smaller than yours and they just fit those boots perfectly
# would you like a raisin
# mm
# okay let's go hear that hurdy
# I can't wait to hear it
# I'm listening
# oh_my_goodness
# my clog is the hurdy
# that's a beautiful black hurdy
# are you turning the handle raccoon
# do you remember the hurdy
# Griz is going to swim in the water

# blueberries in the car I bet that makes a big mess
# you think so
# the big vacuum cleaner not even the Dust_Buster
# you need to use the regular vacuum
# to vacuum out the mess in the car
# oh he must be a very little bear to make such a big mess
# only little kids make really big messes
# 'cause big kids know how to be a little neater and clean up after themselves and they big kids don't drop their blueberries all over the place
# because they know that it's good to put them right in your mouth
