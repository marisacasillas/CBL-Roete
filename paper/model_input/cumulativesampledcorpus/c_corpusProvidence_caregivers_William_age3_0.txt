# today we open the big big bridge
# what wonderful news everyone cheered
# the mountains were beautiful
# the people of Soder couldn't wait to visit them
# there it is
# what's that
# it's a big big bridge that's right
# everyone wanted to see the big big bridge
# it had towers so high that tops touched the sky
# and the valley beneath was so deep that when you were on the big big bridge you could barely see the ground
# Thomas was excited about the new rail line
# this is really a special day he said happily
# look who's this
# is that Henry and then Henry chugged up to Thomas
# the big engine frowned
# I don't want to go to the mountains Henry said nervously
# it's windy up there very very windy
# Henry didn't like the wind
# Henry didn't like rain or snow or hail either
# we're a big engine Henry Thomas said you shouldn't be afraid of a little wind
# but Henry was afraid
# that made Thomas a bit afraid too
# look at there's everybody who's this here
# that's right
# Gordon
# Gordon Henry Thomas hitch up your coaches called sir Toppenhat
# it's time for your first trip to the mountains
# Percy and James were glad they didn't have_to go to the mountains
# they were afraid to cross the big big bridge
# there's nothing to be afraid of Thomas insisted
# in a voice loud enough for Percy and James to hear
# it will be easy to cross the big big bridge
# ah who's that
# that's Thomas
# Thomas and Henry chugged to the platform Gordon the express engine was already there  excuse me
# his coaches were full of passengers
# Annie and Clarabelle were soon hitched behind Thomas
# hurry hurry they called
# but they
# who's that
# that's Thomas and that's the conductor
# that
# this is sir Toppenhat
# that was very good
# and this is the conductor
# all aboard
# cried the conductor
# Sir Toppenhat turned to the crowd and waved his hat one last time
# toot
# follow me
# in a burst of steam the big blue engine was off
# soon the trains were rolling through the country
# Gordon took the lead
# here's Gordon
# behind him chugged Henry and then because he was the smallest came
# who's that
# that's Thomas that's right
# well all along the way people came out of the house and cheered when they saw the trains go by
# at the foot of the mountain Henry slowed to a crawl
# these mountains are much too high he moaned
# I can't go I'm afraid of heights
# don't be silly Thomas said bravely
# I'll be right here behind you
# but Henry didn't budge
# he was nervous
# that made
# c'mon Thomas
# we have_to go
# the brand new tracks were smooth and shiny
# but Henry barely moved along them
# the truth was Henry didn't want to reach the top of the mountain
# because then he'd have_to cross the big big bridge
# if Percy and James and Henry are all afraid thought Thomas maybe I should be frightened too
# finally Thomas and Henry arrived at the top of the mountain
# there it was what's that
# that's right a big big bridge and there's tracks on it too
# you're right
# and it was high
# it was windy up there too
# very windy
# I won't go Henry declared
# but we have_to cross Thomas said bravely
# our passengers want to see the mountains on the other side
# hurry hurry Annie and Clarabelle cried
# the coaches were so excited that Thomas had trouble keeping them in line
# Thomas searched the tracks ahead
# Gordon was nowhere to be seen
# he had already crossed the big bridge and rolled into the mountains beyond
# Thomas and Henry were alone
# I'll go first Thomas said at last
# then you can follow me Henry
# if the wind blows close your eyes Henry said that way you won't see anything scary
# here
# what's this one say
# click_clack click_clack click_clack Thomas began to cross the bridge
# that's right
# there's a click and a clack
# he's a train crossing the bridge
# the big big bridge
# yes there's a click_clack because he
# there was a gust of wind and it made him nervous right and he closed his eyes and then his
# because he he wasn't paying attention to where he was going
# his wheels came off the track

# giraffe
# giraffes can't dance
# alright
# wanna read this one
# let's read this one
# this one's
# there's a giraffe dancing
# yeah the monkey
# hm
# this is Gerald
# Gerald was a tall giraffe whose neck was long and slim
# but his knees were awfully crooked and their legs
# his legs were
# he was very good at standing still and munching shoots off trees
# but when he tried to run around he buckled at the knees
# where every single animal turns up to skip and prance
# see here's a jungle dance
# and this year when the day arrived poor Gerald felt so sad
# because when it came to dancing he was really very bad
# the wart
# the lions danced the tango that was elegant and bold
# are they dancing
# the chimps all did a chacha with a very latin feel
# that's right
# and eight baboons that
# and eight baboons that teamed up
# or a splendid Scottish
# Gerald swallowed bravely as he walked toward the floor but the lions saw him coming and they soon began to roar
# hey look at clumsy Gerald the animals all sneered
# giraffes can't dance you silly fool
# oh Gerald you're so weird
# Gerald simply froze up
# he was rooted to the spot
# they're right he thought
# I'm useless
# oh I feel like such a
# yes you're right
# so he crept off on the dance floor and he started walking home
# he'd never felt so sad before and so sad and so alone
# then he found a little clearing
# and he looked up at the sky
# the moon can be so beautiful
# he whispered with a sigh
# excuse me coughed a cricket who'd seen Gerald early on
# but sometimes when you're different you just need a different song
# listen to the swaying grass listen to the trees
# to me the sweetest music is those branches in the trees
# he's closing his eyes and he's listening
# so imagine that the lovely moon is playing just for you
# everything makes music if you really want it to
# with that the cricket smiled and picked up his violin
# and Gerald felt his body do the most amazing thing
# his hooves had started shuffling making circles on the ground
# his neck was gently swaying
# and his tail was swishing round
# and then he threw his arms out sideways and he swung them everywhere
# then he did a backwards somersault and leaped up in the air
# Gerald felt so wonderful
# his mouth was open wide
# I'm dancing yes I'm dancing
# I'm dancing Gerald cried
# then one by one each animal who'd been there at the dance arrived with Gerald and watched him quite entranced
# they shouted it's a miracle
# yeah it's a miracle
# we must be in a dream
# Gerald's the best dancer that we've ever ever seen
# how did you learn to dance like that
# please Gerald tell us how
# but Gerald simply twirled around and finished with a bow
# then he raised his head and looked up at the moon and stars above
# we all can dance he said when we find the music that we love
# okay let's read the ducks
# mwah I love you
# would you like to sit on the other side
# oh you're going to eat your toast
# okay
# 0is that delicious
# mhm I know you like that
# would you like me to read this book to you
# oh you wanna sit on mama's lap too
# okay
# oh I think that sounds like a good idea
# as you always
# as somebody very
# that sounds like a good idea mom
# this is called make way for ducklings by Robert McCloskey
# Mr and Mrs Mallard were looking for a place to live
# but everytime Mr Mallard saw what looked like a nice place Mrs Mallard said it was no good
# there was sure to be foxes in the woods or turtles in the water
# and she was not going to raise a family where there might be foxes and turtles
# so they flew on and on
# when they got_to Boston they felt too tired to fly any farther
# there was a nice pond in the public gardens
# with a little island on it
# the very place to spend the night quacked Mr Mallard
# so they
# so down they went
# next morning they fished for their breakfast in the
# but they didn't find much
# just as they were getting ready to start on their way a strange and enormous bird came by
# it was pushing a boat full of people and there was a man sitting on its back
# good morning quacked Mr Mallard being polite
# the big bird was too proud to answer
# the people on the boat threw peanuts into the water and so the Mallards followed them all around the pond and got another breakfast
# better than the first
# I like this place said Mrs Mallard
# as they climbed out on the bank
# and waddled along
# why don't we build a nest and raise our ducklings right in this pond
# there are no foxes and no turtles and the people feed us peanuts
# what could be better
# good said Mr Mallard delighted at last Mrs Mallard had found a place that suited her
# but
# look out squawked Mrs Mallard
# you'll get run over
# and when she caught her breath she added this is no place for babies
# with all those horrid things rushing about we'll have_to look somewhere else
# what's that
# it's a bicycle
# that's right
# pedals
# so they flew over Beacon Hill and around the State House
# but there's no place there
# they looked in Louisburg Square
# but there was no water to swim in
# then they flew over the Charles River
# this is better quacked Mrs Mallard
# looks like
# it's only a little away from the public garden
# yes said Mrs Mallard remembering the peanuts
# that looks just
# so they chose a cozy spot on one of the bushes near the water and settled down to build their nest
# and only just in time for now they were beginning to
# all their old wing feathers start to drop out
# and would not be able to fly again until the new ones grew in
# but of course they could swim and one day they swam over to the park on the river and there they met a policeman called Michael
# Michael fed them peanuts
# and after that the Mallards called upon Michael every day
# yeah
# after Mrs Mallard had laid eight eggs in the nest she couldn't go visit Michael anymore
# cause she had to sit on the eggs to keep them warm
# she moved off the nest only to get a drink of water or to have her lunch or to count the eggs and make sure they were all there
# one day the ducklings hatched out
# first came Jack then Pack then Lack then Mack and Nack and Wack and Pack and Quack
# Mr and Mrs Mallard were bursting with pride
# it's a great responsibility taking care of so many ducklings and they kept them very busy
# yeah there's a mommy
# one day
# Mr Mallard decided he'd like to take a trip to see what the rest of the river was like
# off he sat
# I'll meet you in a week in the public garden he quacked over his shoulder
# take good care of the ducklings
# don't you worry said Mrs Mallard I know all about bringing up children
# and she did
# she taught them how to swim
# and dive
# she taught them to walk in a lines to come when they were called and to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels
# when at last she felt perfectly satisfied with them she said one morning come along children follow me
# before you could wink an eyelash Jack Kack Clack Mack Nack Quack Pack Quack fell into a line

# let's read
# you wanna read giraffes can't dance
# you wanna read
# or
# you wanna read this one
# or this one
# okay
# mkay
# that's for William
# no
# they what
# okay alright
# that's fine we'll just leave it here
# thought I would try
# see look at
# here's the dance giraffing making all these beautiful moves
# Gerald was a tall giraffe whose neck was long and slim
# but his knees were awfully crooked and his legs were rather thin
# he was very good and standing still and munching shoots off trees
# but when he tried to run around he buckled at the knees
# now every year in Africa they hold the jungle dance
# where every single animal turns up to skip and prance
# and this year
# oh and this year when the day arrived poor Gerald felt so sad
# because it
# when it came time to dance
# the wart
# the lions danced the tango that was elegant and bold
# the chimps all did a chacha with a very latin
# they're doing chacha that's right
# and eight baboons then teamed up for a splendid Scottish
# Gerald swallowed
# okay alright alright
# alright
# yeah
# yeah those are the chimps doing chacha see and here they are watching
# Gerald swallowed bravely as he walked toward the floor but
# no they're not doing dancing no they're watching
# but the lion saw him coming and they soon began to roar
# hey look at clumsy Gerald the animals all sneered
# giraffes can't dance you silly fool oh Gerald you're so weird
# Gerald simply froze up he was rooted to the spot
# they're right he thought I'm useless oh I feel like such a clod
# so he crept off from the dance floor and he started walking home
# he'd never felt so sad before so sad and all alone
# then he found a little clearing and he looked up at the sky
# the moon can be so beautiful he whispered with a sigh
# excuse me coughed a cricket who'd seen Gerald earlier on
# but sometimes when you're different you just need a different song
# listen to the swaying grass and listen to the trees
# to me the sweetest music is those branches in the breeze
# so imagine that the lovely moon is playing just for you
# that's Gerald
# everything makes music if you really want it to
# yeah wow
# that's what the cricket's telling him that if every
# that if he listens to the music of his own song that he can
# with that the cricket smiled and picked up
# yeah what listen
# the violin that's right
# with that the cricket smiled and picked up his violin
# then Gerald felt his body do the most amazing thing
# that's right
# his hooves had started shuffling making circles on the ground
# his neck was gently swaying and his tail was swishing round
# he threw his arms out sideways and he swung them everywhere
# then he did a backwards somersault and leapt up in the air
# Gerald felt so wonderful his mouth was open wide
# I'm dancing yes I'm dancing I'm dancing Gerald cried
# then one by one each animal who'd been there at the dance
# arrived while Gerald boogied on
# and watched him quite entranced
# they shouted it's a miracle we must be in a dream
# yeah Gerald's the best dancer that we've ever ever seen
# how did you learn how to dance like that please Gerald tell us how
# but Gerald simply twirled around and finished with a bow
# and he raised his head and looked up at the moon and stars above
# we all can dance he said when we find music that we love
# put those on
# you gonna put your sneakers on
# look Mommy has sneakers on today too
# yeah
# these are like sneakers you're right
# okay here
# I think
# that
# maybe if you sit over this way
# you wanna show
# you want me to show you how I do it
# put the sneaker on
# you know how to do that cause you do that all the time don't you
# yeah I know you do
# okay
# tie it tight
# loop
# loop around under and through
# and I do it again
# cause yours always come untied

# Mommy really really wants to
# let's
# let's try to clean up this area
# clean up William's little area here because
# lookit

# I thought maybe we would clean up
# you see that blue box over there where all your little trucks go your little cars
# we could put that on the table
# we could take the big ones down
# right
# you'll find a place for them
# but in the mean time I thought maybe we'd straighten out
# you could take the tools like this
# put them in your tool bin
# under here you have a tool bin right here

# we can
# we can read The Very Hungry Caterpillar
# we can
# you know what I think I'd really like to do
# you know
# no you know what I'd really like to do
# I'd like to do the dinosaur puzzle
# don't you think that would be fun
# William
# I'm not watching tv
# yeah but I'm not gonna watch tv
# I don't wanna watch tv
# I'm getting this horrible feeling that you're watching an awful lot of tv and eating and awful lot of food on the couch with Sue
# because you are behaving like that is the case
# and I think we need to unplug the television
# that's what I think
# can I help you with that
# this can be a little difficult to get off
# here it is
# okay
# it's empty
# it is
# so
# do what
# you wanna do the outside like we did the first time
# you wanted to pick all the outside
# we'll get all the outside pieces
# see the ones that have straight lines like this
# ones that have straight lines
# you wanna do that
# we'll pick all the ones that have
# well we know that this is the bottom
# alright
# here let's try to
# oh I know I should let you do it your way
# yeah you wanna sit over here
# you're gonna
# you have_to do the red
# do you see what I'm doing
# oh yes
# I'm
# you don't want that
# well I thought we were gonna do the outside so what I'm doing is I'm taking all the pieces that have a straight
# look it
# I'm taking all the pieces
# look look
# alright
# you go right ahead see if you can find something that goes with it
# you'll do
# I don't know
# I know
# let's turn all the pieces over
# we'll turn them over so you can see
# see
# I don't know let's see what we can find
# there
# that looks like there's some right on that right
# mm I don't know
# there it looks like
# I see some red on that one
# oh what that
# what do you think that is
# maybe that's the body
# hm
# they look like they might match too
# oh I think you're right
# that's great William
# yes
# that's very good
# you've got it
# oh
# is this the piece you were
# that's the one you had originally right
# where does it look like that red would go
# yeah
# you think so
# where's the red on the dinosaur
# yeah
# I think you're right
# you just need to
# oh you know what
# I shouldn't have done that cause you can do that all by yourself
# there you go
# yeah
# oh very good that's right
# you think yeah
# hm
# look at patterns
# look it can you
# do you see that pattern on that piece that you have in your hand
# you do where is it
# the one you just put
# picked up
# right there
# look at this piece
# and look at this piece
# is there any patterns that match
# colors
# no
# oh
# I see
# oh right
# I know
# let's look for that pattern
# green with the tan hm
# oh
# mhm
# I know I don't know
# where
# where oh where could it be
# there it is
# oh
# hm
# oh yeah yeah just a little piece of it isn't it
# just a little piece cause it's almost the end
# wonder where it could be
# I don't know
# I don't know
# ah what d'you think about that one
# I don't
# you think it's by the tail though
# I was thinking about the tail
# you betcha
# we're looking for her tail huh
# oh that one
# we're lookin' for we're lookin' for body
# I don't know
# hm
# is that it
# oh that does look like it would be the tail of that
# let's see what's down here
# oh well you know what
# you could always look at this picture
# whoops that's why I have
# that's why I have the picture there
# yeah that's why I have the picture there because
# right
# well where do you
# look at that picture and where do you see that
# do you think that goes there
# you do
# there's this dinosaur right here
# I don't
# I don't see
# I don't see this right up near
# do you
# oh I don't see that
# I see little front legs somewhere
# I wonder where that is
# that's what we need to be looking for ah
# you do
# it looks like that's
# that
# it looks like that piece
# if you look at this picture right
# this piece looks like it goes over this way more doesn't it
# doesn't it look like it might be over here
# yeah I think so I think we need to find something that's in between
# I think we need to find something in between there
# yeah you just have_to look at all the
# look at all these pieces around
# do you see anything that might fit there
# you do
# okay well where do you
# where do
# where is it
# yeah
# okay
# how would that
# how does that match
# I'm gonna put this overhead light on cause maybe we can see better
# a little bit better
# yes
# me
# no I think you'll find it eventually
# let's go on to a different part of the puzzle
# how bout we look at this one
# let's look up here
# come on I think it's fun to do it that way
# look it I'll try it I'll do it
# there
# you think so
# oh
# hm you think it would go on there
# look it cause it looks like it's down there doesn't it
# oh see how bout that
# mhm
# yes
# I know
# I'm not certain that that would go there William
# lemme see
# look at the picture
# where do you think that would fit
# looks like there's lots_of rock right
# look at
# look for that color
# where do you think it looks like it matches to
# you think so
# that looks like that's where the body would go hm
# I'm not sure that that would go there William
# look at the colors
# you're looking for
# look it you see this is like this and it's like this
# right
# what is
# what does that foot look like
# how bout the
# match this color
# this color it goes
# this is here
# well there's a little bit here but it doesn't seem to match the picture
# now what about down here
# does it look like maybe it could go down here
# how do you think it would fit there
# ah
# there you go
# you did it
# mhm
# you know what I would look at
# look at the leaves
# how can you line the leaves up
# looks like there some leaves here
# and some leaves here
# see the leaves
# do you think that might work
# you did it
# what d'you mean you can't do it it's done
# now you're looking for
# what d'you wanna look for now
# yeah
# mm what do you think would go there
# look at this picture
# looks like the body
# right
# you're gonna look like
# you're gonna look for a body that looks like that
# that's the
# this is mostly this body part isn't it
# the big
# the middle part of that dinosaur
# and you're gonna look for little arms
# right
# mhm
# I don't know you'll have_to look at your pieces and see what you find
# look at your pieces
# look at the pieces all around
# you have these pieces all around on the floor
# see what you can find
# see what you can find
# there's what
# where
# right here
# oh
# oh yeah you're right
# you can do it
# you've been doing it so good
# I know you can do this
# I need you to help mommy
# can you show me how to do it

# woohoo
# oh yeah
# oh okay
# right there right there
# that's right the tail's just behind him
# oh
# I don't know where is her
# oh
# mm I think that maybe it's time to start looking at some of these
# somewhere
# welcome
# I think maybe that goes
# do you think that might go down here
# like there
# right
# I think that might go over that way by those flowers
# well that
# it just doesn't match that one
# cause it maybe
# that's the corner
# that's the corner so it's over here somewhere
# that's all
# I don't know if that goes there
# that might not go there either
# here here's another one you can try this one
# &-uh and this looks like it might be part of that grouping
# you think so
# I'm not sure about that
# try this one here
# alright I think that's it
# it might be that one yeah
