# 0i didn't do anything all that exciting
# just visit the library
# that's exciting
# I had a quiet
# Mommy's microphone
# play
# kay ooh clunk
# ooh clunk
# kay
# there you are
# there you are
# okay
# it's  today is June twenty June twenty fifth
# everybody's on
# that's making a good noise
# and I'm gonna test the microphone by clicking the
# c_d player controls
# could hear those very well if this is working
# Naima
# hm see how do I test hers
# do you wanna put on the c_d player
# can you put it on
# no
# okay
# let's see we gotta give her
# play baby
# Mommy will play with you I just wanna get you some crunchy food
# can you come here for a second
# oh that's a bowl
# would you like a crunchy piece of wheat
# no
# shoulda heard that pretty loud if hers is working
# mm kay
# mm
# boy that's stale
# yuck
# mm kay
# okay
# I am testing f one
# if it's working
# you should be able to hear this very clearly
# that was the
# okay I'm gonna shut f one off
# no I'm not I'm gonna leave it on
# turn on f two
# this is a test of the
# I'm close
# I can't play right now because I'm figuring out this equipment
# you've got a nice cup though
# so I'm
# bledder bledder is right
# so I've got it on f one
# I'll try it on f two later
# on the receiver of f one and f two are
# but there is no
# I do not have the transmitter for f two on
# and I'm close to the camera now so I'm gonna walk outside
# this transmitter is working
# cause I'm gonna be talking constantly
# right here
# well and you definitely would not hear me without the microphone here
# so this transmitter itself is not the problem
# if this sound is working
# okay
# and replay that
# okay
# on the receiver
# the f two switch is on off
# rather than on on
# and the other transmitter is still also off so
# you shouldn't be able to hear me
# if I
# if you can hear me now then
# look there's
# hi
# hi
# you gonna open the door for her
# good job
# thank you
# how are you today
# you
# okay tha
# okay this is a test of
# the transmitter which is on f one right now
# and you definitely should not be able to hear this if there's a problem
# now this should be fine cause I just tested it
# this is the one that I thought was not working because it had a new battery
# but I did just change the battery so it has a second new battery which may have been the problem
# and if you can hear this it's definitely fine
# kay now I'm coming back to the camera
# I was in the other room
# and now I put on the one that's on f two
# and walk into the other room
# what is
# if I jiggle the camera a little
# the green lights are on
# okay
# the green lights are now on the receiver
# they were kind of jiggling
# &-um off and on to red
# which is bizarre in and of itself
# it may be a separate problem
# and now with this transmitter on f two
# I'm going to walk away
# and if you can't hear this
# at the same volume right now then
# receiver is not functioning properly
# right
# okay stop
# okay a double test of the hypothesis that the f two channel on the receiver is the malfunction
# I've just switched transmitters
# the one I have I'm putting onto f two
# both green lights on the receiver are on
# they're on green
# and I'm walking into the other room speaking at the same tone of voice
# and you shouldn't be able you should be able to
# sounds like I'm getting louder and louder now then the hypothesis is correct
# okay
# let's find your back
# where is the back
# where's your back
# where

# mm
# the old gray donkey Eeyore stood by himself in a thistly corner of the forest
# his front feet well part his head on one side and thought about things
# sometimes he thought sadly to himself
# so when Winnie the Pooh came stomping along Eeyore was very glad to be able to stop thinking for a little
# in order to say how do you do in a gloomy manner to him
# and how are you said Winnie the Pooh
# gloomy
# gloomy
# Eeyore shook his head from side to side not very how he said I don't seem to have felt at all how for a long time
# that is
# Piglet
# and here is
# who's this
# Kanga
# and who's that
# yeah
# dear dear said Pooh I'm sorry about that let's have a look at you

# it isn't there
# are you sure
# well either a tail is there or isn't there you can't make a mistake about it and yours isn't there

# and you know the
# how's doing he's big now
# right I mean
# oh boy
# oh boy oh boy
# when we last saw him he was just a little slip of a thing
# are you still nursing or did you
# &-uh huh
# yeah
# yeah
# yes I do
# yeah
# &-uh huh
# &-uh huh
# yeah
# yeah
# yeah well I'm doing that and she's almost two so
# yeah
# yeah
# well
# I I wasn't gonna force the issue
# &-uh huh
# oh he
# yeah she run
# mhm
# mhm
# mhm
# mhm
# mhm that's good yup
# mhm
# mhm
# mhm
# mhm mhm
# mhm
# yeah yeah
# mhm
# mhm
# mhm
# well it's partly
# it's not completely good or bad it's partly about what your level of tolerance is I mean that
# yeah sure
# no I
# I don't I don't like I don't like it I wish it weren't happening but I'm also not willing to do
# well I mean I am willing to do what it takes to reduce it but not to
# and and I think she
# it is
# but the
# I mean no that's an exaggeration but
# cause sleep is important that's why
# for all of us
# she doesn't have a sleeping problem cause she sleeps right
# I mean she barely wakes up to nurse
# so it's not a question about her not sleeping it's a question about me not sleeping
# no &-um what we did
# is
# so she sleeps on that much of the night
# and she
# so she's farther away from me
# and I either go down to her bed to nurse her
# and and I try to just wait and see if she's really waking up to nurse or not
# you know so
# cause sometimes she'll almost wake up but then she'll go back to sleep without being nursed
# so it's also about listening carefully and waiting
# but anyway sometimes I'll go down to her
# I mean I'm not I I don't feel feel like I have an ideal situation
# can I can I tell you about a book that I like though about this topic &-um
# Elizabeth Pantley is the author
# it's called the no cry sleep solution
# and she is someone who has worked with &-um
# &-um and I I like her approach cause she's kind of like she's kind of like &-um
# well it's hard to describe but you know middle of the
# like if you need to sleep she's got suggestions on what you can do and yet she
# recognizes there are lots_of people like me at least who want like no crying
# but want to sleep
# so it's kinda like way
# like possible ways of making that happen
# and it didn't
# I can't say that
# stuff like that so it's not like you have_to follow a plan
# yeah oh I think she's got some really good ideas and
# apparently I mean
# and I was also on an an email group of people who are following her plan and there's like eight hundred people on the list
# so I don't follow it I mean I kinda like I just kind of abandoned it for the time being but but I but I think a lot of people are actually having success with her method
# and a lot of people aren't too I mean I'd say that it's like one of those things
# so
# Furbur yes
# yeah yeah
# yeah
# and the yeah go back yeah yeah
# yeah
# right
# yup yeah
# mhm think of
# think through what you might wanna do
# mhm
# mhm
# yeah
# yeah
# yeah
# and that's hard for him
# yeah
# yeah oh
# oh I have
# you know that's exactly what has happened to me
# I just started at a certain point I started getting insomnia
# like inability to go back to sleep
# and that just completely complicates things
# and I think it was around when she was age that that was happening to me too
# &-um I can jump to the punch
# unlatch the baby when you're nursing
# him to sleep
# &-um before so that he doesn't actually fall asleep with a nipple in his mouth
# and she's just kind of suggests that you do that religiously and repeatedly
# you know until he kinda unlearns that's the only way he can fall asleep
# yeah
# yeah
# she's not saying that to do that
# yeah sure yeah yeah
# okay now we can read bunny cakes
# now we can read bunny cakes
# bunny cakes
# who's in bunny cakes who's that story about
# Ruby and who else
# yeah
# where's Max in that picture
# he's sitting in a mixing bowl
# silly Max
# ha ha ha
# let see ah we gotta make sure Mommy's your head it's on Mommy's mice
# hm what's he have in his hand
# ha
# that Max
# I can't believe he fits in the mixing bowl is he that little
# he must be little if he fits in a mixing bowl
# this is still March first
# bunny cakes
# oh here's some pictures of things
# what do you see
# yeah those are eggs
# let's count those eggs
# good counting Naima
# one two three four five six eggs
# that is a spoon
# do you see where the mixer is
# does that look like Mommy's mixer
# it's Ruby's yeah that one is Ruby's mixer
# oh cause there's two pictures here
# I see the butter I thought Ruby uses butter to make the cake
# I think that's the butter
# yeah rubber spatula
# I think Ruby uses the rubber spatula to mix the cake
# and she also uses
# the whisk
# and oh there's the flour what's the flour in
# in a red bag isn't it
# with a number two on it
# and I see some measuring spoons
# and a measuring cup
# Mommy has a cup like that
# okay bunny cakes
# it was grandma's birthday Max made her an earth worm what
# no Max said Max's sister Ruby we're gonna make Grandma an angel surprise cake with raspberry fluff icing
# what's he doing there
# it looks like he's using a metal spatula to mix his cake
# which is really just made out of dirt
# that's actually dirt he's pretending to make a cake out of dirt
# okay
# Max wanted to help
# don't touch anything Max said Ruby
# you think she does I think he does want to help Ruby
# does she want him to help
# I don't think she wants him to help
# you think he's gonna touch the eggs
# he might what's Ruby doing with that egg
# she's breaking it into the mixer
# mixing bowl actually she's breaking it into the mixing bowl
# she's holding on to the shells and letting the egg white and the egg yoke going into the bowl
# what she making do you remember
# yeah
# but it was too late oops what happened
# he broke the eggs
# well you can't really fix eggs once you break them
# you have_to throw if you break them and they go on the floor you have_to throw them in the garbage
# maybe maybe Ruby will help Max clean that up and put it in the garbage
# maybe they'll do it together you think so
# yeah maybe Max and Ruby will do that
# Ruby send Max to the store with a list that said
# eggs
# Max waned red hot marshmallow squirters
# for his earth worm cake so he wrote red hot marshmallow squirters on the list
# he wrote it with a red crayon except he's a little bunny and he doesn't really know how to write
# he can't write he's a bunny but he's trying he's trying to write he wants to add red hot marshmallows squirters to the list so the grocer will give them to him
# that's a kind of candy
# the grocer could not read Max's writing
# eggs said the grocer and he gave Max eggs
# Max brought the eggs home to Ruby
# oh I think they're in that red box
# don't bump the table Max but it was too late
# what happened
# he spilled the milk
# yeah
# she said don't bump the table Max but he did bump the table you see he's bumping into it right there and the milk bottle is falling over the milk is going on to the floor
# oh oh who do you think is gonna clean that up
# I think she's going to ask Max to help her clean it up don't you think
# when you make a mess you should help clean it up right
# Ruby sent Max back to the store with a list that said
# milk how do you spell milk
# right
# great m i l k spells milk very good Naima
# this time Max wrote red hot marshmallows squirters in a different way
# he really wants that candy
# Max hoped and hoped for his squirters but the grocer still couldn't read Max's writing milk said the grocer and he gave Max milk
# what else is the grocer selling there
# yeah
# and what about over there
# I think those are crackers
# yeah
# Max brought the milk home to Ruby
# what did she do Naima
# what did she draw
# she drew a yellow line on the floor next to the table
# there's a yellow line on the floor Max said Ruby
# you can't step over that line
# I think she's a little bit mad
# he's bringing her the milk
# but Max
# he crossed over the line
# oops what happened
# what did he do
# did he spill
# he spilled the flour
# oh oh over went the flour
# Ruby got out her pencil and she
# over with the flour clonk
# Ruby got out her pencil
# what did she write
# she wrote flour how do you spell flour
# f l o u r
# flour
# this time Max wrote red hot marshmallows squirters in the most beautiful writing he knew
# he's using a crayon isn't he
# Max could almost taste the marshmallows squirters
# flour said the grocer and he gave Max flour
# oh I think Max might be unhappy
# that's the grocer
# the grocer doesn't know that Max wants the candy because he can't read what Max wrote on the list
# Max is just a little guy he doesn't really know how to write or talk properly
# that's the door to the kitchen
# these are trees over here and that's the door to the kitchen and there's Ruby inside holding a spoon
# when Max got home there was a sign on the kitchen door
# Max this kitchen is no place for you said Ruby
# Ruby finished up her cake whose ears do you see outside the window
# those are Max's ears
# Ruby won't let him into the kitchen
# he's outside looking in yeah
# Ruby finished up her cake she baked it and cooled it and iced it with raspberry fluff frosting
# she's using something to put the frosting on the cake
# oh she gave him a spoon of the icing
# he's eating some of the icing just a little spoon full
# he's trying just a little bit
# he's outside the window looking in
# she's using a knife to put the frosting on the cake
# that's a very pink cake
# it needs something else Max said Ruby
# birthday candles silver stars sugar hearts butter cream roses wrote Ruby
# mean while Max had a brand new idea
# he drew a picture of red hot marshmallows squirters on Ruby's list and ran to the grocer
# what's he pulling behind him
# yeah it's a red wagon there
# maybe he's going to carry the food from the grocery store in the wagon when he goes home
# what does the list say
# it says birthday candles silver
# sugar
# and butter cream
# and what're those
# he drew a picture of red hot marshmallows squirters
# on Ruby's list and ran to the grocer he could not wait
# well he won't have_to wait too long
# birthday candles silver stars sugar hearts butter cream roses said the grocer what's this why it must be a red hot marshmallow
# squirters
# Ruby's cake looked just beautiful
# Max went out and put caterpillar icing on his birthday cake
# on his on his earth worm cake
# what's he doing what's he having in his hand
# what's he doing with the knife
# he's putting caterpillar icing on the cake with his knife
# Grandma was so thrilled she didn't know which cake to eat first

# isn't it beautiful Max said Ruby
# thirsty said Max
# you may buy a very very small lemonade Max said Ruby what's she giving him now
# she's giving him her wallet do you think that's a good idea
# next door in Candy's corner window were hundreds of vampire teeth
# Max knew grandma would love a set of teeth with oozing cherry syrup inside for her birthday
# okay
# he bought them instead of the lemonade
# two dollars please said Candy
# Max wanted to make sure the teeth worked he put them in the teeth worked perfectly and Ruby had to take Max to the laundromat what're they gonna do with the laundromat
# what're they gonna do what's this
# a washing machine
# and what's Ruby doing over here this is Max
# this is Ruby's hand
# I think Ruby is cleaning off his face with a washcloth
# because he has mess on his face
# soap cost a dollar the washer cost a dollar and the dryer cost another dollar
# money down the drain Max said Ruby
# hungry said Max
# it was lunch
# Max finished off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich two coconut cup cakes and a banana shake lunch costs four dollars one two three four
# what does she have left in her wallet
# yeah
# money is running through our fingers Max said Ruby
# they walked all the way back to Roselinda's gift shop without spending another penny
# oh now what's happening in this picture
# well Roselinda is telling Ruby that the music box costs a hundred dollars
# but she doesn't have that much she only has a five dollar bill
# and Roselinda shows her the blue bird earrings that play oh what a beautiful morning
# they are on sale for four dollars
# we'll take them said Ruby she's gonna buy those earrings for her grandma

# it is the wallet is empty there's no more money in it
# Roselinda gives Max the change you take care of this dollar young man

# I think it's a duck lion
# could we call it
# could we call it Lionel
# that could be the duck's name
# Lionel
# or do you wanna give the duck a different name
# Koalaba
# I think I'll rewind this a bit to double check it

# oh_my_goodness is Arthur gonna baby
# that means he's gonna take care of those children
# Arthur is here walking past his friends
# he's telling them I'm going to take care of those twins
# who is that
# what kind of ears does that animal have
# what kind of animal is that
# is it a rabbit
# oh let's see what's happening in this picture
# oh_my_goodness
# that baby's diaper is leaking
# you can see the drops of pee
# and Arthur is
# Arthur's pants got all wet
# yeah I think that baby's diaper is leaking
# he needs a new diaper
# I think the baby is crying
# and that's D_W
# she's crying in that picture
# and what's happening in that picture
# that baby's throwing up
# remember you threw up when you were sick
# I think she is sick
# she's throwing up some green stuff that came out of her tummy
# that's what happened to you when you were sick
# you were throwing up also
# yeah sometimes it was orange
# that's what the baby's throwing up
# cause she's sick she needs to have some medicine maybe
# and here's a picture of Arthur and his sister D_W
# she's jumping on the sofa
# Arthur's trying to read a book
# his sister's making a lot of noise
# that's Mrs Tibble
# she has to go out
# the cat looks like she's hiding
# yup she might
# well D_W's not in this picture
# there's D_W
# okay you wanna look at this page
# D_W's jumping on the sofa
# that's Arthur who's holding the crying baby
# that's his sister I think
# oh she's having pee
# it's leaking
# she needs her diaper changed
# Arthur has to change her now
# she's throwing up
# that's Arthur
# he's saying yuck
# let's see what happens next
# those children are playing very rambunctiously
# yes Arthur is holding the throwing up baby
# Arthur's holding the baby who is throwing up
# I think maybe he's trying to help her feel better
# hm I wonder where Daddy is
# he was supposed to come home
# maybe he's reading his paper at work
# that's D_W
# she's crying
# her overalls
# she's wearing a dress that looks like overalls
# what is she doing
# she's laughing
# there's all of Arthur's friends
# are you saying to Mommy to read some
# Arthur remembered what that was like
# now he was really worried
# there I read it
# I think that that
# can you read the letters there on that book that D_W was reading
# what letters are those
# can you see them
# oh you wanna talk about that picture with the babies throwing up
# do you think Arthur might give her some medicine to help her feel better
# yeah
# there he is
# he's her big brother
# do you want me to talk about that picture
# that's the picture where the baby's diaper is leaking and Arthur's pants are getting wet
# see how the pants are dark on his thighs
# that means the baby's diaper leaked
# the baby's diaper leaked and made Arthur's pants all wet
# I think he probably will get another diaper for that baby
# and he will probably also change his pants
# what thing away
# those green things are the throw up that is coming out of the baby's mouth
# oh you think he'll clean it up
# yeah you're right
# he'll probably clean it up
# he'll probably get a wet rag and clean it off of this chair
# clean the green throw up off of the chair
# and then put the rag in the laundry or throw it away
# I think he will because he's the one who's taking care of the baby
# when you're taking care of someone who's sick you do that kind of thing
# you clean up the throw up and stuff like that
# she is throwing up
# I bet she doesn't feel good
# she probably feels lousy
# I'm so glad you're better though Naima
# Naima is all better
# what happened with the nurses
# in the hospital
# they did a lot of things to take care of you
# well
# they put a special bangle on your arm which had blue tape on it
# and they connected a hose to your hand
# so that you could get the medicine that you needed
# they checked to make sure you had enough medicine
# well they took your temperature
# by sticking that thermometer in your ear
# they took your temperature
# they listened to your chest with a stethoscope
# one of the nurses gave you a grizzly
# it was Janet who gave you the grizzly
# I think Barbara did take off the blue bangle
# which was like a bandage
# she took off the blue sticky tape that was on your arm
# she took out the needle
# there was a needle
# she took it all off
# oh and you had a bangle on your ankle also
# that's right and she took that off
# I think that had your name on it
# you had that bangle on your ankle too
# I forgot that
# and you had some kind of a special night
# what was it
# what was on it
# was it bears
# what was on the night
# &-uh
# I think maybe it was little bears
# little pink bears
# and
# mm
# oh you're right it was elephants
# you had the special elephant night
# and there was a special crib there
# do you remember that crib
# and Mommy slept next to you
# on that chair
# next to your crib right
# and Mommy nursed you too to help you feel better
# remember
# you were sick yeah
# well &-um
# the book fell down that was on my lap
# the nurses brought food for Mommy to eat
# they took away your diapers after I changed you and they weighed them
# on a scale
# a scale is for finding out how heavy something is
# it measures how heavy something is
# we weighed Naima too
# we weighed you
# you weighed twenty five pounds
# again
# we already talked about it

# &-uh
# yes
# and I don't know you know what the solution is
# obviously these guys are in a rush
# yeah
# well I can call and just mention it to them at least
# so that it doesn't go completely &-um
# you know
# looks like you're outta food there
# do you want something else to eat Naima
# whatd'ya think
# I don't think that we're out of it but I do think that you could have something else
# like
# raisins
# or what else
# is that what it feels like
# your hair was a little outta control there
# how bout some bread with
# oh how bout some bear food Naima
# are you a bear cub that wants to eat bear food
# or you could have some egg yolk
# I'm the mommy bear
# and you're the baby bear
# Poppa_Bear
# the story of Goldilocks
# I need to tell you that while you're eating
# what are you gonna eat
# you're gonna have some fresh grated apple
# does that sound good
# I can do that but what are you gonna eat while I'm telling it to you
# I will tell it to you but you've got_to be eating something
# okay
# it's a deal egg yolk and egg white
# yes
# good idea Naima
# first I'm gonna take the shell off of the egg
# mhm
# cause we don't eat the shell with the eggs
# how do you spell egg
# it does have a g in it
# egg is spelled
# e g g
# this shell does not want to come off this egg
# it's difficult and Mommy's having a tough time with this egg
# you think Daddy will do it if Mommy can't do it
# hm
# while I'm doing it it's just a
# I didn't cook the egg properly
# that's why the shell is sticking to the egg
# like tape
# yes tape sticks to photographs sometimes
# especially in the book we made for you called Naima's journeys right
# is that what you're thinking of
# alright let's see here
# let's slice this egg for you
# should we get a plate maybe
# what color plate's that
# here's some egg white
# here's some egg yolk
# mm big chunks of egg yolk
# they look like chunks of cheese
# go head and eat some and I'll tell you the story of Goldilocks
# once upon a time there was a little girl who went on a walk in the
# forest
# she saw a snake
# you like that variation don't you
# she saw a snake
# she saw a robin
# she saw a badger
# she liked walking in the forest
# so that she could see all the different animals
# she was having fun but she was walking for a long time
# and then she got tired
# and she first she found the house
# a house up ahead
# she was hungry and tired
# so first she decided to knock on the door
# knock knock knock
# but there was no answer
# so she walked in the house
# and then what happens next
# what does she
# she wants to find the bears
# what does she see when she walks in the house
# three chairs yes three rocking chairs
# a big one
# a medium sized one
# and a little one
# and then
# she sat in the biggest rocking chair
# and she started to rock and rock
# but then she stopped
# and she said this rocking chair is too
# fast
# so she climbed out of that rocking chair
# she got into the next rocking chair and that was the medium sized rocking chair
# and she rocked
# and she stopped and she said
# wait a minute this rocking chair is too what
# slow
# so what did she do
# she climbed out of that rocking chair
# and
# she climbed into the little rocking chair
# and she rocked
# and she said oh hey
# I like this rocking chair
# it's just right for me
# and then what happens
# she's rocking in that little rocking chair for a long time right
# she rock and she rocked
# until it broke into bits
# right
# and then what happens
# she wants to fix it
# well she's a little girl she doesn't really have access to tools and screws
# and she's in somebody else's house
# she doesn't know where they keep their tools so she can't fix it
# so she goes into the kitchen because she's hungry
# I think you're right Naima
# I'm slicing a bagel
# cause that's what I'm going to eat for breakfast
# a bagel's like an o isn't it
# so she goes into the kitchen and she sees
# what does she see on the table there
# yes
# three bowls of porridge
# and one of them is big
# and one of them is medium sized
# and one of them is
# little
# she sits down in front of the big bowl of porridge and she takes a bite of it
# she says
# oh this porridge is too hot
# she needs to cool it down
# then she goes over to the medium sized bowl of porridge and she takes a bite
# she makes a face like this
# then she says this porridge is too cold
# so she gets down outta that chair
# she goes to the littlest bowl of porridge
# she takes the spoon dips it in the porridge then sticks it in her mouth and takes a bite
# and that porridge was just right
# that's right Naima you know this story don't you
# where's Mommy's coffee
# and
# and then she keeps eating the little bowl of porridge
# and she eats and eats
# until what happens
# she finishes it
# that's right til it's all gone
# and then she wants to wash her bowl off
# okay and so then she takes the bowl and she takes it over to the sink
# she puts some soap on it and she uses a sponge
# and she washes off the bowl until it's all clean
# it might've been that she wanted to dry the bowl
# and cook more porridge what a good idea
# mommy bear
# is Goldilocks mommy bear
# I don't think so
# she's in the bears' house though
# she's in the bears' house
# she washes the bowl and she puts it back
# she doesn't cook more porridge I don't think so
# not in this story anyway
# she's tired right
# so she should find a bed to sleep in
# she goes upstairs and she climbs into the biggest bed that she sees
# and she tries to get comfortable
# and she says &-uh wait a minute this bed is too hard
# she can't get comfy it's not a comfy bed for her
# and then what happens
# and then she climbs out of that bed and goes into the medium sized bed
# she tries to get comfortable
# I can't get comfortable
# she says this bed is too soft it's like sleeping on a big fluffy pillow
# and then she gets out of the medium sized bed and she goes over to the littlest bed of all
# what happens
# she's in the littlest bed and she says mm oh this is so comfy
# this bed is just right
# and she falls asleep
# the medium sized bed is the one that's too soft
# the littlest bed the little bed that's right
# the little bed is the one that is very very comfy
# she falls asleep
# and pretty soon what happens
# the bears come home to their house
# they walk in the door they want to rock in their chairs
# they go into the living room and papa bear sits in his chair and he starts to rock
# and he rocks a couple of times and then he stops
# and he says somebody's been rocking in my chair
# he's very puzzled
# I think you're right
# I think Goldilocks has been rocking in the Poppa_Bear's chair
# and then
# and the mama bear goes and sits in her chair
# right
# she starts to rock and what does she say
# she says somebody's been rocking in my chair too
# mhm I think you're right
# yes Goldilocks is still sleeping upstairs at this point
# and then the baby bear goes over and
# there's a bird over at the feeder Naima
# birds are coming to eat
# can you see them
# there's a lot of sun in this room
# there now you're out of the sun
# can you see the birds
# oh maybe they'll come back
# you rearranging your cups
# hey you ate a lot of that egg good job
# what else would you like to eat
# sesame
# okay let me find the sesame for you
# would you like a pile of sesame right here
# here's a pile
# well I forgot to buy jam at the store yesterday
# we're almost out of strawberry jam
# what else would you
# you're eating the sesame is it good
# good
# do you wanna eat some apple
# I'll get you some apple
# you want bread and jam
# you can have some of my bagel
# there's no more jam right now
# do you want apple
# okay
# you want some plain bagel
# I think there's
# what happened to that
# &-uh yeah you can have some of my plain bagel
# let's see here
# this is Mommy's plain bagel
# and I can get you some apple sauce
# oh yeah the other part of the story &
# where did we leave off
# the baby bear looked at his rocking chair
# and it was broken
# and he said someone's been rocking in my rocking chair and they broke it
# ugh he was kinda mad I think
# so then
# mama bear said don't worry we'll fix it
# and then where do the bears go
# into the kitchen
# cause they're hungry
# they've been out walking so they're hungry too just like Goldilocks was
# when you walk for awhile you get hungry
# they've been walking for a long time
# &-um so the papa bear looked at his bowl he didn't even have_to take a bite
# he just looked at his bowl and said somebody's been eating my porridge
# oh no there's an uhoh here
# yes I think Goldilocks was the one eating his porridge
# I hope your elbow hasn't been in the way over here
# let's attach this over here
# and then the mama bear also says
# somebody's been eating my porridge too
# I think you're right
# and the baby bear looks at his bowl which is completely clean remember because she washed it out this time
# and he says somebody's been eating my porridge
# and she ate it all up
# she washed out the bowl and it's completely empty
# I think maybe the baby bear starts to cry at this point
# do you think so
# and the papa bear says don't worry we'll make you some more porridge
# so the bears ate all their porridge
# then when they were done eating they went upstairs to take a nap
# you're having sesame with apple
# who likes the bagel in her porridge
# oh
# she likes bagels with porridge mm
# hm I'm just remembering something
# okay
# they go upstairs and the papa bear says somebody's been sleeping in my bed
# the story of the day
# I'm still telling the Goldilocks story
# you mean you wanna hear what we did yesterday
# okay
# &-um yesterday was Wednesday
# we woke up
# Mommy made coffee
# and in the morning we went out and did errands
# we went to the bank
# we went to the hardware store
# we bought a rake at the hardware store just for you
# and then we went to the
# dry cleaner's
# we stopped in the shoe store for a minute
# we stopped to make sure that your shoes were still the right size
# that was very quick we didn't stay there for very long
# you have cold feet

# can you reach it
# you can what
# it was in the bath
# you'll find another set of socks

# I was wrong
# that did fall down
# what yellow things

# that are glued to the bath
# no so that a person taking a shower won't slip
# it's okay they're just plastic
# yes honey
# are you scared
# just give me a nice big hug
# why are you scared
# of the plastic
# plastic is nothing to be scared of honey
# you won't have_to pinch me I'll carry you
# it's plastic
# it won't hurt you
# do you hear that
# good
# the camera is making noise but I also heard the church bell
# I think it stopped already
# that's the camera
# let's hurry up and hang those things up so that we can go to the play
# we need to hang them up first
# you a little scared
# &
# do you wanna go in the living room while I finish hanging this up

# I'm not doing anything to it
# it doesn't matter
# nothing needs to be done with it
# nothing at all
# yeah plastic butterflies
# that's what they're for
# but you know what we don't even use this bath
# we don't even take showers in it
# do we
# we just use it to hang clothes
# right
# you wanna touch the
# plastic butterfly
# wanna touch it
# want Mommy to touch it
# okay
# Mommy will touch it
# yeah I'm rubbing it
# it's flat
# it's almost like a piece of paper
# here actually you know what it peels right off
# this is it
# the plastic
# we could throw them in the garbage
# see it's plastic
# should I see if I can get the other one off
# you're standing on me
# let's see if I can get peel the other one off too
# we don't really need to have them in here

# you know that garbage and you lift up the lid and put the butterfly in the garbage
# yeah
# yeah we took it off and we
# put it in the and you Naima put it in the garbage

# cause it's kinda stuck
# I'm not gonna do it right now right now what I want to do is finish hanging up the laundry
# you are
# you smell very nice
# you were but then you touched it and you put it in the garbage
# you're not scared of that anymore I don't think so
# yeah you know what I think that might be paint from something that you painted that was drying there
# I think that's what that is
# here's another sock you could hang up
# this is no actually
# cause this is gray and that's black
# you're gonna need to look here
# try to find a gray sock that matches
# I don't know if it
# it might not even be here
# let's see where's the matching one
# lalie lalie nursie
# you can hang that up even though we don't have the matching one right now
# why don't you go and hang that up
# can I show you something
# okay watch me do it
# I'm putting it over but then I'm gonna pull the other side
# because that way it won't fall down easily
# yeah that's another plastic butterfly
# there's another sock
# who's sock is that
# that's a Daddy sock yeah
# member what I said about pulling it
# here I'll get it for you
# try again try again
# try hanging it up again
# no use your other hand
# that's okay
# kay put it up there
# yes and then what you should do is hold onto it and then bring this down so that it hangs like that
# see that way it'll stay up it won't fall down that way
# I'm showing you how to hang up the sock
# there's another sock
# try using both hands to make it stay
# like I showed you
# where's your other hand
# where's your other hand
# nope nope nope lemme have this hand
# give me this hand

# now go behind it and find the other end
# and pull it like that
# see that way it hangs

# d'you need help taking your diaper off
# you don't
# okay
# poopy diaper's got nothing in it
# I'm gonna check it though

# d'you wanna read one of your potty books
# while you're waiting
# yeah I think that actually they're both over here
# the white one
# you like this one
# that little girl has a blue potty just like you
# you have a blue one also
# and she has a cat
# a brown cat
# she has a brown cat

# fill it with popcorn
# no
# wear it on your head
# no
# sit on it
# yes
# do you know what goes inside
# and poop of course
# of clourse
# I think she is
# and so is the cat
# when I feel it coming I run for the potty
# wooph
# I pull down my pants and sit myself down
# then I fill the potty with my very own pee
# good job Naima
# I think you peed
# yeah
# you could poop too if you want
# you wanna pull down that flap
# she has
# yeah she has green pants on
# looks like she's pulling them down herself
# yes
# I think she probably is
# are you a big girl too
# I think so
# then I wipe myself
# that's important because I want to keep my underpants clean and dry
# mm that's the toilet paper
# then
# oh yep
# someone older
# mhm

# like a grown
# mhm
# oop
# Mommy will help you with that okay

# there
# I think that must be the bathroom
# this is the door to the bathroom
# oh there's her potty
# yup
# that's a good question
# you can't see the grownups' potty in this picture
# you don't know
# good question

# okay
# did put the pee
# yeah
# mhm
# back on

# byebye pee
# now let's

# after is more important than before
# okay let's put soap on your hands
# you know I want you to wash your hands before you touch anything
# the thing is after you use the potty

# Dadaji and Babaji are watching a movie
# I forgot I had a movie
# hey that was good
# you're eating orzo with a very big spoon
# that spoon is as big as Naima
# ah let's see
# well I mean the tomato sauce won't work for my dad
# &-uh no &-uh I was gonna make &-uh I have some
# probably olive oil and garlic or something
# I have mushrooms
# oh I dunno I should ask him probably about the mushrooms
# and actually I'll make whole wheat pasta for us but he can have this little bit of orzo that she's having
# tomato &-um mushroom and olive I do have olives
# &-uh so mushrooms are fine babe
# oh good okay
# what about olives
# I dunno

# olives are okay too
# okay
# good
# that's great
# and onions garlic he can have that without restriction
# yeah onions and garlic
# is that good Naima
# is it yummy
# great
# I think maybe tomorrow I will have a noncooking day for myself
# and &-uh now he can't eat tofu but that is either that or the  how am
# well I mean he can eat small amounts
# cause I was gonna maybe throw in the the marinated lemony garlicky tofu into the mix
# or have it on the side that way people can do what they want
# an' we can make a salad too
# you want more orzo Naima
# you do
# save some for your dad if possible
# oh is the whole wheat not good for him
# I right he avoids whole wheat
# oh that's right he eats
# and you want some tomato sauce too
# there
# is it hot
# I dunno
# what's Daddy doing
# just a little snacking
# mm
# Daddy's eating something called cashews
# it's a kind of a nut
# I think animals probably like cashews too
# oh do you not have a pocket in these
# or you probably do
# no
# oh well
# take it off if you can
# you wanna to listen to Portishead
# oh you were cooling the pasta down I wondered what you were doing
# you're cooling it down yourself
# hm
# like this
# yes yes I've seen her do that before
# those azaleas outside are really nice looking
# mm
# one is pink and there's a red one coming in
# I was thinking maybe we should all go for at least one meal we should go to like to the paddock or something
# mhm I had the same thought
# it might be busy though although if we went &-er &-um
# this is a weird weekend
# you want more orzo
# okay
# more orzo for the Boo
# want more tomato sauce too
# you think one of these is enough for all of us
# yeah
# there's twenty one
# twenty one grams of protein in this whole thing that's not enough for four adults really
# no
# three plus fifteen
# or I could fry this up
# temper
# yeah
# that would probably be tastier especially if you threw it in with the
# this salsa only has twenty one
# well your dad's
# oh
# right he'll he'll have maybe four or five grams the rest of us will have more
# no
# miss Naima boo you're having a good supper
# actually that's add some soy
# you could switch cause I did start this tape because I thought we'd get your parents in here on and maybe segue into them talking about this or that so
# mhm
# it's okay if it's a hybrid tape I think have_to be
# you are having a good supper Naima I'm glad to see you eating it
# mm
# that's the only problem with a Friday call if
# if it's bad the whole next day is kinda shot
# mhm
# you want Portishead

# you could listen later to Portishead
# somebody's got a little bit of a short fuse this afternoon
# nursies are in the world

# I know Naima but you know what Babaji and Dadaji are watching it
# and Daddy wants them to watch it and I wanna be able to watch it sometimes
# he wants them to have fun too and they're having fun watching it
# they're our guests
# then let's figure out something fun for you to do
# I know you do I know you want to but actually I don't think we're going to because Babaji and Dadaji are listening and they're watching
# they are
# you want some garlic hummus
# look at this mushroom

# got lost did he
# I know
# you didn't run into deer poop
# well they were
# I don't think the deer actually come into the strawberry patch to poop
# do you have a twenty four hour video camera
# I think it was one of these things where they were right on top they were you know
# here
# well it's hard to to do it by hand
# why don't I use the knife
# to make it easier to eat okay
# oh
# oh you got strawberry in your eye
# close your eyes for a minute and then I'll they'll feel better if you close them for a little
# not not hard just lightly
# you don't have_to shut them that tightly look how Mommy's closing her eyes
# see I'm not squeezing them that's squeezing them I'm just shutting them
# now just close em now
# as if you were asleep
# yeah
# here have some strawberry
# what's Naima doing
# are you recording
# yeah

# I'm sitting across from you
# Daddy's sitting across from you over here
# mm
# thanks for the coffee
# Miss Boo_Baloo
# you're welcome and I'd be happy to go get some
# something bad
# croissant
# from Fancy's
# well what I was gonna say is this place might actually be open on Sundays since it's different ownership
# I know but
# yeah I guess it's worth an extra few minutes
# they had
# no
# on a Sunday it's hard to predict people's opening times
# yup yeah
# well and what what was Fancy's on Sundays
# in fact weren't wasn't Fancy's closed also on Sundays
# oh I drove out there and it was closed
# yeah I think so
# the difference was the Saturday hours
# yeah you're right
# I think Fancy had longer Saturday hours
# you're right
# but this place is unknown
# oh I hate
# the other thing is we could go out but that involves everybody getting ready to go out which takes too long
# it's a huge production
# I could make something but
# and it's gonna be really crowded today
# well higher bout early in the morning
# there is the &-uh race today
# I dunno
# I don't
# what race is it
# it's the Johnny Kelley ten_k I think
# oh
# and I I don't exactly remember the route but
# is he gonna run in it
# I think he does actually
# is he your patient
# no
# think I think he's &-um he may still see Mac I don't remember
# I don't wanna have it because you've been squeezing it
# I will have one that you haven't been squeezing
# do you wanna give me a piece that you haven't been
# okay
# thank you Naima
# mm that's nice for sharing
# are they delicious Naima are they good
# the strawberries
# mm wow
# is it tasty Boo
# squeeze it sweetie
# don't squeeze it eat it
# you don't wanna eat them anymore
# you want some yogurt with it
# okay
# what could we make here that would be easy
# why
# oh you don't wanna mix them
# you don't wanna mix up the yogurt and the strawberries
# here comes the yogurt
# lucky
# you could doinkaboink it with Oatios or wheat if you want to
# or strawberry
# or both
# dya want wheat or Oatios
# just strawberry
# how bout wheat germ
# okay
# I don't
# no don't do that
# Naima
# that's making a mess
# I'm gonna take all the food away if you keep doing that
# Naima hold still there's a strawberry down here
# somewhere
# just making
# I have a feeling you don't like these strawberries
# is that right
# you don't wanna do yogurt
# you didn't have any yogurt
# remember this this bowl has letters on it
# it's a j
# baby Bjorn
# spells baby Bjorn
# I would actually like to get more of these bowls
# and the spoons that go with em are just right too
# I think they're too deep they're too much like her bowl
# the spoons
# the spoons or the bowl
# the spoons
# the ones that match that
# yeah isn't it the short handle on the round
# yeah
# what's too deep
# they're not deep
# they're the same about the same as this
# there was a bird at the feeder
# what was he doing
# he was eating some seeds
# how did he know that the seeds were there
# that's a good question
# how did he know that the seeds were there
# because we put them there maybe he saw us putting them there
# that would be one way he would know
# not the weeds
# we planted the seeds not the weeds
# we want the seeds to grow not the weeds
# flowers
# the weeds were flowering
# you were helping me so much when we were pulling weeds down at the garden the other day
# you were tugging them up yeah
# you were tugging weeds
# we have lots more things to plant in our garden
# beans and I ordered some more seeds from a kind of a rare seed place
# a french pumpkin
# a french pumpkin
# why
# how Frenchist
# a french pumpkin
# how Frenchist
# sorry your hair is in your yogurt on your face
# &-um some flowers
# what did I order
# I just kinda did it on a whim
# well we have beans we need to plant
# and Daddy has bachelor's buttons
# oh yes bachelor's buttons
# good idea
# you have_to find a special place for them with Daddy
# yeah
# you gonna make a row for them just like we made rows in the garden
# you could do that
# I would spare space if you wanted to have them in the vegetable garden
# boy the birds are really feeding
# and they're chirping
# are they hungry
# I think bachelor's buttons need sun right
# or at least partial sun
# you know what might be a good place
# this area right here actually gets morning sun
# yeah I know
# I don't think it does all day
# I know
# but you could just clear out some of whatever's there and put them
# this variety is tall bachelor's buttons
# yeah
# see how tall they are
# maybe Tuesday when it's if maybe if it's not raining
# drought tolerant
# in the vegetable garden
# we could plant them there too
# early spring one to two weeks before last frost so really they should be
# yeah it's it's a perfect time
# yeah
# seeds require dark to germinate
# completely cover
# mm
# some some don't
# okay does not transplant well
# two to three foot tall that's really tall for bachelor's buttons
# huh it'd be interesting
# no three feet is common
# two to three
# well you see you see them from time to time
# I've never seen bachelor's buttons that tall
# mm
# I have up to here
# well then it's a variety for you
# that'll be nice I think that would be a good place
# mm
# would you like some toast to eat Naima
# I'll toast the toast for you
# well the toaster's unplugged that's okay
# I think we don't have enough maple syrup to really make
# yeah we have very little in fact I keep meaning to tell you
# I haven't been using it so I haven't noticed
# I'm looking for bread so that I can make the toast for you
# there's bread in the freezer
# yeah I just
# I'm not a big fan of bread in the freezer
# why am I fanning
# oh I wasn't talking about the fan
# she was talking about a different kind of fan
# there's a different kind of fan called a fan somebody who likes something a lot is called a fan
# that's short for fanatic
# oh what's the fan gonna blow out
# fans blow air
# but when people are fans we mean that they're fanatics
# that means they really like something a lot
# that means they really really really like something they're called fans
# what was used to go in the house fans
# the big fan
# upstairs in the ceiling
# oh in the old house you mean
# in the old house the big noisy fan
# mhm
# is that what you were remembering Naima
# no
# oh
# the plastic smell
# Daddy was blowing fans out
# dya want some fresh banana
# okay
# but I'm making the toast
# I'm making the toast now
# I do
# we picked them
# Naima's gonna help me plant them when the weather's a little bit better when it stops raining
# yeah it's not good to really do gardening when the ground is wet cause you spread things all over the place
# yeah
# we do need to tug up more weeds well maybe who knows maybe today it won't rain very much and maybe it will get a little dryer and maybe we can do things outside
# well anyway I didn't finish telling you all the other kinds of seeds we're gonna plant
# beans we have beans to plant
# we need to get some poles to put the beans on
# and we're
# and we're gonna
# at the pole store
# yeah I'm gonna order some from the pole store
# it's not a real store it's a thing I have_to buy on the computer
# you can do it with me
# you can do it with Mommy
# yup you can do
# but you have_to just sit at the computer and do it
# and we'll look at a picture of it and buy it
# boy I'm tired
# I know
# there is a pole at fire
# and you slid down the pole and actually do you remember when we went with Grandma to the Museum of Science there was a play
# we helped you slide down that pole
# miss little firefighter girl
# dya remember that play
# it had wiggly
# what did it have
# wiggly turtles
# no what were those
# it had a wiggly seahorse
# oh yeah a wiggly whale
# mm
# and a wiggly duck
# wow
# I dunno if it had a turtle did it
# I think there were three two or three wiggly things
# wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly
# wiggly wiggly wiggly you were going back and forth from one to the other
# wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly
# they had things to climb on
# there were other children there there were swings
# well the lack of croissant on Sunday morning is an argument for moving to the city
# a city
# &-uh slides
# Portland
# it's on the train line
# said it takes a long time cause it stops everywhere
# yeah it's a slow train at this time of year
# do you remember anything else at that play
# do you want almond butter on your toast
# dya want regular butter on you toast cow cow butter
# this hair situation is bugging me
# you know what I'm gonna put your hair up in a bun because
# just like you lucky girl
# because your hair is getting food in it and not that
# you lucky girl you're gonna have your hair in a bun
# if your hair gets food in it it will get snarls
# just like we'll have_to show your bun sometime
# yeah
# I have_to go
# and we could even put some chopsticks in it someday
# oops
# I dropped the hair
# alright what would you like on your toast Naima boo
# cow cow you want some cow butter
# this is cow butter
# she's just getting cow butter out for you boo
# you don't want
# Mommy will do it by herself
# I guess she will do it by herself nobody is helping her
# trying to make the toast for you
# I'm melting the butter onto the toast
# now it's called butter toast
# butter toast butter toast
# butter toast
# butter toast
# butter toast
# boy I remember that time I was sick and I was eating like massive quantities of tea n' buttered toast and nothing else
# where in
# yes
# I remember that almost more than being sick
# well if I made something here it would be
# the advantage is I could make it sort of pseudo healthy
# why is that flashing
# oh the tape's almost over how could that be
# hm
# dya running it at a fast speed
# oh
# what does that mean even
# mm a couple of speed settings
# I didn't know that
# I think
# but wait how could
# I mean
# but unless it was changed it should be on the default
# well
# the higher speed I think gives you greater fidelity allegedly I never really looked into it
# I should read the manual I suppose
# well we could have a whole hour on it I spose
# are you eating your toast
# dya want jam on it
# what jam do you want on it boo
# there's I think there's either strawberry or apricot
# think that's in the door
# strawberry jam for Naima coming right up
# I'll take this
# I'm putting strawberry jam on for you
# it's sticky
# okay I'll put it on that one
# there that has a lot of strawberry jam
# that's sticky too
# I guess I don't feel like cooking cause the amount of dishes that ends up getting generated is just
# it's like three meals a day for four people is like constant cooking and cleaning up
# she's putting her own spoon in that jar so we have_to
# and your elbows are over toast
# you could use the knife to try to get out the jam
# boy that's azalea's so bright
# don't you use the knife
# hold onto the jar with one hand and then put the knife in
# put the knife in and scoop it out
# that's not how we eat jam we eat jam on toast

# I had to talk about what kind of food we're going to order
# what kind of food we want the truck to bring
# that's what I was doing
# well because
# the co_op is a group of people who have_to pick out things and have to decide things

# that's kinda what a meeting is usually
# the food co_op yeah

# Daddy did a good job didn't he
# you started to do the zipper
# which zipper
# does the big pillow have a zipper
# oh I guess I didn't know that you can show me afterwards
# yes I am
# what's going on in this picture
# there's a snow
# take your hand off the microphone though
# there's a snowstorm happening
# cause there's snow coming out of the sky out of the clouds
# mm weather watchers had been predicting a big snow
# &-uh what kind of a truck is that
# that is a snowplow
# it's doing what to the snow
# what did you say it was doing
# factoring the snow
# it's
# those that part of the snowplow pushes the snow
# mm so that the cars can drive you're right
# cars can't drive through this kind of snow
# so the plow is
# even before the snow stopped falling town work crews were out with their trucks to begin a long hard job of digging out
# mm
# oh we skipped a page
# look at all the houses and buildings and schools and there's a church
# they're all covered with snow
# all the buildings and look I think that's a snowplow over there
# it is
# and do you know what these are
# these are electric wires
# they're carrying electricity from
# building from one building to another
# or maybe those are telephone wires actually
# hm those might be electric and telephone wires
# the wire that you saw at Craigville beach with Daddy and the ducks that you saw on the way
# you remembering seeing those things
# you saw a wire in the sand huh
# did Daddy say it was he thought it was for a phone that they used to have in the lifeguard's chair
# I think that's what you told me
# remember we saw a lifeguard today at Douse's beach
# she was wearing red
# and a red swim
# she was a lifeguard
# lifeguards sometimes wear red
# yes they do they like to go in the water with swimsuits
# well lifeguards are there in case anybody has trouble in the water and they need help
# lifeguards are there to go and and give them help if they need help in the water
# because if you don't know how to swim sometimes you can have
# &-uh difficulty in the water swimming
# and you need some help you need someone to help carry you
# but you're not gonna have that problem cause you'll learn how to swim
# there's the plow again I see it
# it's orange
# I also see a whole lot of school buses covered with snow
# dyou see them
# right there
# all the school buses are covered with snow and they're not
# because there's too much snow
# yeah
# that
# mhm
# that boy is holding a teddy
# that's a family who is waking up and looking out at the snow
# and finding out
# oh boy everybody's having fun here what's everybody doing
# you tell me what do you see
# she is
# about to throw a snowball at
# that kid
# and that kid is throwing a snowball way over there
# they're having a snowball fight
# that means you make balls out of the snow and you throw them
# snowball fight
# that's a game it's kind of a game that kids play
# big kids play
# cause it's fun to make the snowballs and then they throw them at each other and they go phwack
# phwack
# thwack
# oh the dinosaur the dinosaur's tail sounds like thwack you remember that
# yeah
# oh did that hurt
# &
# I see some kids building
# the kid in the red jacket is making a snow
# that's a huge snowball I think
# that maybe they are building a an igloo
# out of snow
# or a snow fort
# I think that's she's carrying some snow to build a wall there
# it's fun to build things with snow
# it's just a fun thing to do that's all
# and I see a lot of kids who are sliding on sleds down the hill
# in this picture
# that sled is being pulled by a mommy
# mhm

# bear parties

# rivers

# when you're done with your snack
# so that we can buy more smoothie
# because

# he's gonna help people feel better
# patients
# what do you think
# you know the answer to that question
# he's gonna check their hearts oops
# well I just realized that your bib and your microphone fell down
# some time ago perhaps
# there
# he's gonna listen to their hearts with a stethoscope
# what else does he do to help them feel better Naima
# he looks in their ears with an otoscope
# I don't think he does that a lot but I think once in a while maybe he does that
# he figures out what kind of medicine they need
# I'm cooking onions and garlic
# and green hot spicy peppers
# cause I'm making chili
# and chili's also gonna have black beans in it
# and tomatoes
# and we're gonna eat it for supper later on
# you'll have chili
# well right now it's just onions it's not that interesting
# but
# when it's all cooking everything's in it you can have a look at it
# your hand's going away
# oh it's very dark outside isn't it
# I think it's overcast
# you think it's gonna snow or rain
# it doesn't really snow in the summer
# just summer is not a time when there's snow
# winter fall and spring are the only time when it snows
# &
# what was he doing there
# he was actually he was giving you little hugs
# he wanted to touch you and give you hugs
# and he actually give you a kiss on your back he's a very sneaky kisser

# there's a phone on that wall
# floating in a floaty and dialing for help
# probly dial
# y'know what
# I bet
# cause if there's a flood
# the fire department is one place you could call to help you get rid of the flood
# this is a flood when water goes where it's not supposed to go and there's a lot of it
# that's called a flood

# well I wouldn't wanna build a nest right near some foxes
# and I wouldn't wanna live in a nest where there wasn't any food near by
# and I wouldn't wanna build a nest next to a play ground where there're lots_of noisy children all the time
# I wouldn't build a nest in a refrigerator

# ha ha ha ha
# I wouldn't wanna build to build a nest near a camera
# why Naima

# and here are the children riding bicycles the birds better watch out
# those ducks better watch out so the bicycles don't run them over
# oh_my_goodness they almost ran them right over
# hm so they flew over beacon hill around the state house but there was no place there
# they looked in Lewisburg_Square but there was no water to swim in
# they flew over the Charles_River
# oh that's where they gonna oh they found an island and that's where they going to build a hah look at that there's their nest
# who's that
# oop
# those are teenager birds
# well it just needs to be close to your mouth that's all
# because it's it's recording your voice
# is that what you want them to here
# okay
# is that like what a baby says
# but they wanna know about what a toddler say
# is that what a baby or toddler says
# toddler
# is the name of that police officer
# that's his name
# hah look at that what do they have in the nest
# one two three four five six seven eight there're eight eggs in the nest
# hah and pretty soon they hatch and they have eight chicks
# ducklings really those are ducklings
# what do you think the mama duck says to the ducklings
# their children
# because the bicyc the person on the bicycle didn't realize that there were ducks in the way
# here're the ducks they're growing up and getting bigger now they're kinda like toddler ducks
# oh the mommy still takes care of them
# she's teaching them how to swim and dive
# that's how they get around they swim and that's how they look for food in the water
# here they're they're lining up
# she's teaching them to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels
# that's kind of like when I tell you have be careful in the parking lot
# and that cars are dangerous she's she's teaching them the same thing she's saying cars and bicycles and other things on wheels are dangerous cause they can bump into you
# that's just what Mommy taught you Naima
# do you remember I taught you that
# do you remember
# why
# is it almost nap time
# let see what time it is
# oh it certainly is nap time
# it's past two o'clock
# do you know what we we have that we can use at nap time now
# the tape player
# yeah and do you know what I brought in from the car for you to listen to in the tape player
# I brought the jamboree tape in
# would you like to get into bed and start nap time

# what book is that
# what
# what's that
# that's a mattress it use to be in your baby bunk
# when you were a baby
# that's a mattress we used for the baby bunk
# that's the right size for the baby bunk
# because a baby bunk is like a little bed for babies
# that's what you use to sleep in
# because the baby bunk was attached to Mommy and Daddy's bed
# and you were too little to be in the bed so we had to attach your bed to our bed it was a little tiny bed
# and you know who's borrowing it right now
# Molly and Mellisa
# cause she's going to have her baby
# cause the baby's been inside long enough
# now the baby's ready to come out and say hi to its mommy and nurse
# probably
# why
# why do why does why do babies do that
# yes we do
# yeah
# when when baby comes we mail that present to the baby or we'll bring it to him
# so he can play with it
# it's a baby toy
# well baby toys are just like a little things they can pull on or push on or look at
# little babies don't really have very interesting toys for toddlers
# I put on your oh I put on your big kid pants backwards
# Mom me

# who eats hay do do people eat hay
# horses do
# there's another goat at a farm
# that goat's being milked
# somebody's getting some milk out of the goat's udder
# goats have an udder just like cows do
# do you sometimes people drink goat's milk

# sometimes baby goats drink the milk
# are goats mammals
# yes they are
# are you a mammal

# Fed_X eats a Fed_X bone
# a Felix

# have you ever seen a Fed_X dog
# that would be a great idea
# they could save money
# if they had dogs
# I bet the unions wouldn't like it though
# with the bone say Fed_X on it
# with those orange and purple letters that are on the truck
# truck has big orange and purple letters
# it just what the truck looks like
# why am I old
# you mean why's Mommy old
# I just am
# I've been around a while

# here's some lentils
# Naima I have some delicious hummus here
# hey hummus Mommy has hummus
# you want some
# with cracker maybe
# smells
# let's brush your teeth now Naima
# why do they what
# well so they don't run into the land and break the ship that's why
# why because ships are for the ocean they're just for floating in the water they don't come on land
# and sometimes if they hit the land they can break
# and water can get on the ship and it could sink so they want to stay away from the land
# and when it's foggy they can't see the land
# and if they can't see the land they don't know where it is that's why fog horns help them fog horns help them know where the land is
# come sit here little ship
# so when it's really foggy all they have_to do is listen
# and when they listen they can hear the fog horn and that tells them oh there's land there we better stay away
# so whenever they hear it
# can you face me so I can brush your teeth
# they know to stay away
# are you a ship
# oh you better listen for fog horns then
# oh boy
# can you face Mommy so I can brush your teeth
# Daddy is a fog horn
# Daddy what's today's date is it the twenty first
# yes it is the twenty first
# it's August twenty first two thousand and three
# we're on vacation
# why are we on vacation Naima
# to spend the time at Maine
# that's a very good explanation of of a vacation
# and because Daddy doesn't have_to go to work that means he can be with us and play with us every day right
# are we gonna do &-uh get a yoga card after we do this tooth brushing and a sticker
# yes
# and we'll use the tape player we'll do all those good things
# what beautiful teeth you have my dear
# okay do you wanna have a little little sip of water
# no
# no
# yes
# should I get a little glass of water for you
# okay
# you don't have a glass of water you don't have_to have a glass of water
# but I am actually going to brush my teeth now
# you wanna sit here while I brush my teeth
# you wanna
# you wanna walk to Dad

# hey there's some good ones
# there are some good yoga cards here Miss Naima
# you wanna do that one
# okay
# let's see let's read what it is
# this is called the side stretch not a very Sanskrit name
# the side stretch
# stand with your legs wide apart
# actually you probably shouldn't do it on the here on the you should do it over there
# right in front of your right here right here
# right in front of your &-uh yeah that's it
# stand with your legs wide apart
# put your legs wide apart really wide really wide really wide that's it good
# that's good no that's too wide
# there that's good
# take a deep breath in and stretch your arms out at the sides like this just like that yeah
# like that that's good
# actually we didn't finish it Naima
# stretch your legs put your legs wide apart that's it
# further further more more more good
# arms out like this and then
# you turn your feet towards the right side and that one too
# that one too
# both no both feet pointing that way
# that one too
# pointing this way
# like that yep
# and then you bend you stretch and you bend like that
# that's how you do it
# you wanna read a good library book tonight
# which one
# okay
# oh my gosh Naima we're not gonna read ten books tonight
# we are not reading ten books tonight Naima
# you could pick a few

# oh that's not is that the good one
# do you wanna sit on my lap

# alright I just wanna adjust this
# oh Heather has two mommies
# alright
# remember which library this was from
# right can I put this on your lap
# we'll look at the book whoops
# I guess not okay there we go right there
# whoa
# I love you too
# you're a sweet little mommy
# I didn't know you were a little mommy
# swikka dikka dameek
# a swikka dikka dameek
# oh
# you're a sweet Naima
# you're getting warm are you cold
# we should put some pajamas on you
# it's almost time for sleep whoa clunk sleep time
# your nursie drops you off at the Nurney's house
# oh_my_goodness
# I never heard of such a thing
# I never heard of such a thing
# do you wanna wear your blue and yellow pajamas or your pink and orange pajamas
# I don't know about any pajamas
# nursie pajamas
# hm
# &
# thank you should I put them back in my shirt
# okay they're back in my shirt now
# computer nursies
# what are computer nursies
# what
# are you being silly Miss silly
# shall we get pajamas now
# you want the pink ones or the blue ones
# I don't know about any nursie pajamas
# you want a nursing shirt
# Mommy is the one who wears nursing shirts
# not Naima
# you don't have any nursing shirts
# well I'll get the pink and orange nursing shirt
# what d'ya mean no
# you know what we never combed your hair after your bath
# and we should put hair elastics in shouldn't we
# oh okay I see there's a theme here
# I think maybe it's time to stop taping
# the seam
# oh the theme
# do you know what a theme is
# a theme is kind of like an idea
# and I said there's a theme here
# and the theme was that you were talking about nursing a lot
# oh in the drug store at the
# or whatever
# I'm sorry Naima what were you saying
# because Mister Fixit fixed it
# but he's a funny guy Mister Fixit he fixes things in funny ways
# I think he was supposed to fix it so that it would say Mama again two hands please
# oh
# but instead he fixed it and now it says Dada
# funny Mister Fixit
# &-um
# you're having some of this too right
# I don't know
# yes
# careful with the glass
# olive oil
# humor me
# I just need something and I don't have butter
# oh the plate
# almond butter is healthy
# yeah I'm gonna put that on
# salmon
# why did
# I'm sorry Naima I wasn't paying attention to you
# oh he does
# but it's kinda mysterious they don't say why
# they don't say what he does it actually sounds not only mysterious it sounds ominous
# Naima please don't wipe your hands on the table like that
# I don't want you to do that are you gonna eat some egg white and egg yolk
# yes
# so that Sam can play with it
# it's a toy boat isn't it
# is it a toy boat
# no it's a big boat somebody's in it while he's fixing it
# oh
# so that it won't sink
# if a boat has a leak it might sink
# it might go to the bottom
# 0it might go to the bottom of the ocean
# I guess Philip's wagon was broken
# maybe the wheel was broken
# Mister Fixit likes to fix everything he touches practically
# because I think he must have been using the wrong
# he must have been using the wrong directions
# when he was fixing it
# he was supposed to fix it so it said Mama
# but instead he fixed it so it said Dada
# I think he probably was
# like sometimes you need directions to fix things you need to read from a paper with directions
# hm
# like Babaji fixed his refrigerator
# his refrigerator wasn't making any ice
# and he fixed it
# he had to read the directions for how to fix it
# and then he fixed it
# hm and hm
# remember what was I reading oh remember when I was trying to try out the backpack to carry you in
# I had to read the directions
# directions explain how to use something or how to fix something
# mhm
# when it first came when we first took it out of the box
# be careful don't spill that drink okay
# more
# a smoothie is a drink
# yeah I would eat more toast
# I would basically eat toast until toast stops coming my way
# do you want some help getting that out
# you're trying to frost it
# why don't I help you
# mm egg yolk yum yum yum
# it's still a little bit foggy out there Naima
# did you hear the weather
# I didn't
# I mean yesterday it was overcast much of the morning and then it burned off
# it was spectacular
# a spectacular turnaround
# I wonder if fog is a mosquito deterrent
# hm
# wishful thinking
# I don't think so
# mosquitos repelled by fog
# could be the cool temperatures associated with it
# hm
# 0i wonder if there's hot fog and cold fog
# there are probably many different kinds of fog
# but we don't know them
# we would probably have fifty words for fog if we lived in Maine
# and warm fog
# and warm fog
# yes
# probably there's warm fog too
# well you know there's a certain appeal to even though it's foggy at the moment
# to
# taking a day like this to go to Eastport
# because
# mhm no I was gonna suggest the same
# it's sort of the urban entertainment
# all three blocks of it
# well I think Lubbeck is becoming the more sophisticated
# I don't know about that
# urban renewal spot
# The Home_Port restaurant and summer keys
# Naima eat please don't please don't play with that
# the kids in the
# those things have been those things have both been here a long time it's not becoming
# oh yeah
# with your fingers
# with your fingers sometimes you do that sometimes you can do that 0do you wanna knife or do you wanna
# or you wanna
# oh you already did it I think
# okay
# why'ncha eat some
# you can cut one piece and then I want you to eat it
# mm
# is it really shorter to go on the ferries
# oh it in terms of amount of time no it's probably shorter to go the other way cause I think if you drive to Eastport it's probably about an hour
# from here
# yeah
# it's just it's more interesting and more broken up but you know if you go by ferry I mean if it's say fifteen minutes for the ferry each ferry that's half an hour of a wait plus each one is about twenty five minutes that's an hour and a half plus the drive time so
# it's probably longer to go that way
# not that it'll be very spectacular that is really one of the Eastport to Deer Island ferry is just one of those local ferries
# well the thing is if we drove there and then took the ferry back by then it might not
# oh good idea
# babe
# we could get mustard
# oh dear hm
# you know we still have oh
# 0are you talking to Dad I'm sorry
# it's not properly calibrated
# that's alright I'll I'll
# I haven't calibrated my slice thickness
# yes baby
# what is it
# say that again
# oh what mosquitos the fog might do
# I don't quite understand the question but I think you're saying
# I think that's what you're asking
# hm
# cause I said maybe that's
# well Mommy thought maybe mosquitos don't like fog so that the fog will keep them away
# Mommy was more hoping that than thinking that
# I think Mommy was engaging in something called wishful thinking
# yes
# that's called wishful thinking that's when you wish something's true
# even if it's not
# I don't think toddlers are supposed to have that level of reasoning yet
# because toddlers are toddlers what are you doing
# hey what are you doing with the
# d'ya want more
# smoothie Boobaloo
# you can have more smoothie if you want
# does Miss Boo want more smoothie

# you can have egg yolk
# you should eat it
# it's good but it's for you
# yeah I'll eat the egg white
# mm I like egg white
# 0do you like feeding Daddy
# &-um it's a little too close to the edge
# mm Daddy likes egg yolk really a lot
# it has protein in it
# that's the dirty little secret about egg whites
# you did thank you
# right to Daddy
# oh that one
# okay thank you
# a crumb of egg yolk not a piece of egg yolk
# now your turn
# no it's your turn &
# I want you to eat it a little bit more now

# wow
# who's the tower for
# mumbudy
# who's mumbudy
# and a what
# a lick full of homes
# wow
# look at that
# that's a big big tower
# look at that
# what does sclaiming mean
# it's sclaiming
# I guess you do but I don't
# is that a word you made up
# what does it mean
# it clicks up
# that's what sclaiming means
# you mean when the legos click together
# hm
# d'you want me to hold that
# kay
# hm
# see that's making it not fit
# I guess it does actually fit
# it might fall over though
# oh a present for him
# are you going to give it to him
# what a beautiful
# what a beautiful
# what is it
# oh what a beautiful tower
# you need to do what
# cocanit
# is that another word you made up
# oh
# what does it mean
# his back home cave
# what does
# mm
# mhm
# oop
# 0are you upset that that fell
# you want something to put the tree on
# whoop
# I thin
# woo
# that's because that's in the way
# here
# okay
# yeah
# mm
# you know I think we need to stabilize it
# like that
# you can put things on there
# there
# and I bet this would also stabilize it if we put this right here
# then it won't fall so easily
# you wanna put it on top of this
# okay
# mm
# he's gonna be so happy
# it's so nice when someone gives you a present
# sometimes people give presents on birthdays
# mm look Sleepy Naima made you a present
# you're gonna what it
# is that another new word
# what does that mean
# babilize
# oh you mean stabilize it
# look Sleepy Naima made you a tower
# this blackberry bush
# oh
# oh yep that's a good idea
# yeah you could put that one up there
# whoa woopsie_daisy
# you know what
# we can put it back together
# how about if we made one that was a little more stable and it wouldn't fall down as easily
# wait a m
# let's make it taller
# we can still make it tall
# mm oh
# oh that's a nice
# you could put it right on top of that one
# yeah
# it
# it'll go there
# they can't really go next to each other
# I think you have_to put it on top
# for it to fit
# what a nice tree
# it looks just like a tree
# is it a tree tower
# you could make another tree
# it's gonna what
# butter mill
# hm
# what what does butter milling mean
# what does bweeleelee mean
# bweeleelee
# bweeleelee
# bweeleelee
# Sleepy Bear wants to know what that means
# bweeleelee
# he used to say those things when he
# oh those were the baby words he used
# oh you're using those words
# mm
# is he saying thank you
# mm
# he is
# when you're first making it
# and then will you say you're welcome Sleepy Bear
# want me to stabilize it
# is that what Sleepy Bear's saying
# 0it looks like he's looking at it and he likes it
# do we have any more like those
# pajama pajama pajama
# this tower has a snail on it
# hey what are you doing there
# bring that back
# you were trying 0to take it off
# why
# excuse me
# Naima you took off
# you took the
# socket
# why did you do that
# okay
# you don't know why you did
# you want some breakfast
# do you wanna eat pancakes
# blueberry pancakes
# with blueberries inside them
# I think we have little
# oh really
# I didn't realize that
# it looked to me yesterday like we had a fair bit
# no but
# you mean not enough for pancakes for breakfast
# yeah for
# oh well Naima could have just pancakes with the blueberries in them and eat them like muffins
# the ones that are from yesterday
# that are in the fridge
# do you want to have some yogurt
# would you like some kiwi
# the Stitchta_Bear is loofing
# what does that mean
# he's what
# pajumming
# you hit the ball and the panda bear throws it to Sleepy Bear
# and what's that called
# budging up
# he's budging up
# he's watching what
# he pinches his mommy
# he's pinching you I see that now
# you could say
# if you're his mommy you could say don't pinch me Sleepy Bear that doesn't feel good
# you have_to teach him Naima
# 'cause if he's a toddler bear he needs to learn what the rules are and how to be with people like you don't pinch people and you don't hit people
# you don't hurt people
# what're you gonna tell him
# right you still can say it in a nice way but he still needs to learn
# oh no
# you don't wanna hurt your bear
# sounds like the b
# across the border crossing from &-um
# Saint Stephen is gotten very slowed down
# did you read this article
# no
# it's
# they're not saying that but they're implying it 'cause they're talking about new projects for upgrading border crossings
# frustrating to passengers
# I bet since
# 'cause we
# when did we cross there
# was it after nine eleven
# it wasn't it was before
# yeah
# I have a feeling it's really
# slowed down
# the bear's in the chair
# are you in the chair
# 0are you sitting with your bear in the chair
# let's have the kiwi
# did you say you wanted some
# well let's go find it
# mm
# well I'm gonna carry my tea and I'm gonna carry
# the backpack and
# do you wanna sit here at this table Naima
# I think maybe I'll clear off this table and we can all sit and have breakfast at this table which is a little more comfortable
# you're stabilizing those towers
# it does
# okay
# I'm thinking I would like to
# splurge and get a really nice
# and and like
# well actually
# I mean family all family
# oh
# have some kind of a
# oh a very you mean
# like for the whole time even
# well for the whole
# whatever
# yeah
# but but certainly like pick a weekend and say y'know we're gonna have a dinner party or a cookout
# oh okay
# or something
# well to come this far up most people will wanna spend more than a weekend
# sure
# but and we'll need like less of advance
# well for instance here's a sleeps ten
# mhm
# six bathrooms
# mhm
# four king beds
# where's that
# &-uh Alice Head
# ocean front
# oh Alice Head
# oh
# I I recognize myself in that
# is that
# I do too
# yeah
# maybe Daddy can help you
# may I help you Boo
# okay can Daddy sit with you while you do it
# yeah you need something to stabilize it
# steak
# you mean steak like what the bear eats in that book that kind of steak
# hm
# yeah well this is one of 'em
# that I had in mind
# what
# I said this
# well there are a number that are huge like that I mean
# for rent I don't know
# yeah no I've seen sleeps
# you can get sleeps eight sleeps ten
# pretty easily but it doesn't mean they're
# it's actually it's actually sumptuous accommodations
# you're looking through Great Houses For A Family Vacation that's you your children and your friends each have their own
# I thought Daddy said he was gonna sit with you
# well I was refused
# oh that's right
# can I sit with you Boo and help
# what do you want me to do
# can I help
# if I hold it
# okay
# can I make a suggestion
# you don't wanna hear my idea
# alright then I won't tell you my idea
# you know you know why
# you don't need to hear what you think
# what what I think about it
# because things are more stable if they're not on just one lego
# see how this is wider
# if you put the wider legos on the bottom it'll be more stable
# see this is wider
# if you put the narrow towers on top of the wider towers it'll be more stable
# yeah even that is better
# that if I were you I'd put that on the bottom
# 'cause that's really stable that's like a platform
# it's a pretty big tower though
# and you're doing a good job by holding onto it with one hand that also helps
# to keep it more stable
# shall we have a civilized breakfast together
# that would be nice
# what do you think Naima Boo
# do you wanna have breakfast together
# &
# I thought you wanted kiwi
# kiwi is delicious
# let's put the
# she needs to pung it back Daddy
# yes
# oh you want me back here
# okay
# how 'bout if we stabilize it by putting it on that
# it'll help
# you don't think so
# I'm stabilizing it
# alright alright
# you hold it
# you know to make something more stable it will help if you
# &
# see
# put the wider ones on the bottom and the narrow ones on the top
# there
# see it's more stable look at how stable that is now
# and the other thing is it's hard to make things stable on
# 'cause it's sort of uneven
# things would be more stable on that floor which is much more flat
# see this is an uneven floor
# well I meant this kind of
# this part of the floor in the kitchen is more stable
# we'll put this up here
# what's who gonna try and do
# I'm gonna
# mm
# oh
# it's very uns
# oh that's pretty good but
# hey that's pretty good
# hey
# you wanna show Mommy
# hey Mommy
# oh I see that's a really tall tower
# &
# yay
# I think that when you put it on the kitchen floor and moved it from the carpet it helped a lot
# she's making these as presents for Sleepy Bear
# oh boy
# he's a lucky bear
# here's some kiwi
# mhm
# &-um do you want to &-uh
# I I'm happy to make a run and get some maple syrup 'cause it they have some
# I wasn't going to suggest
# I know but
# well I don't
# I mean there's toast and there's jam I don't
# can you can you bring this over and give it to her and and try to wave it in front of her face or something
# 0will you have some kiwi Boo
# Daddy's gonna eat some have some
# it's yummy
# mm
# oh you're right there's hardly any syrup
# do we have a syrup mouse in the house
# we do
# I've been using it in my cereal when I have cereal
# oh oh that's what
# I use it
# allegedly
# well I think it's enough for us to split that last pancake that was
# oh oh we could
# and then we can have toast also
# I mean since we're
# we only have
# two more mornings here I wouldn't really be in favor of buying a whole maple syrup just for that 'cause I don't want to have_to carry back a lot of
# okay
# half used food things
# mhm
# mm I think Naima likes kiwi Mommy
# oh the chair is there
# her special puffin
# hey do you wanna sit up here and eat
# sit properly
# you have your puffin place mat that you like
# did you hear a fog horn
# oh yeah okay
# do you remember that noise we heard last time
# I mean at Head it was a grunting noise
# Daddy said it was a fog horn but Mommy said she didn't think so
# okay
# whee this Baby_oh
# oh I didn't realize we're
# the tape is running
# yeah
# okay this is just barely warm but
# Naima do you want some pancake too
# does
# she doesn't have a mic does she
# yeah
# it's right here
# oh
# well doesn't it taste a little bit like muffin
# it's like a blueberry muffin that's what I thought
# is it also like a muffin shape
# hm
# mm
# that looks pretty yummy
# you wanna split this with me
# &-uh sure
# if there's enough
# I think there's enough syrup for this
# ridiculous
# hm
# these are &-uh luxury rentals throughout the world
# oh
# and there's one &-um
# there's one called Cirrhosis on the Sea
# oh how awful
# it is pathetic
# hm oh here's an island
# the wild beauty of Ireland freeze your ass off
# what
# it says that
# no it doesn't
# why are you even
# well 'cause I'm trying to find Maine coast stuff that might have
# 0are you trying to find the most expensive
# yeah it's &-uh it's like &-uh it's like googling right
# trying to
# here have your pancake
# thank you
# let's all sit together
# okay good
# do you want some soy milk or skim milk
# &-uh soy milk would be excellent
# hey Miss Naima Boo
# can have breakfast
# with you with you Boo
# and I'll put some toast in too
# I don't want toast I might have something else
# cereal
# Daddy doesn't want some
# why
# well I don't think I need cereal but I'm thinking I might like to have some cereal
# 'cause I like my cereal
# t's a good question
# it's
# I like eating cereal in the morning
# just one end
# how 'bout the other end
# mm
# what are we gonna do today Miss Naima
# are we gonna go hiking
# mhm
# you wanna go looking for
# so do I
# I wanna go to
# Cobb's Cook
# mhm
# yes I saw the fly
# and we might see
# mhm that would be fun
# I don't think there are any bears
# except Naima Bear
# Naima Betsy Bear
# Bitsy you're right
# I forgot
# is it good
# it's all gone I'm sorry
# that was just one kiwi and you ate it
# and there's no more
# you could have
# you could have
# blue
# blueberries
# okay
# mm
# is that your blueberry song
# mhm
# &-um which blueberries are the
# there's
# well there's some in the box the organic ones
# yeah in this bowl
# well that's the ones washed left over that aren't organic but you could give those to her I guess
# they're not sprayed so
# I'm gonna go fiddle with the laundry
# there's your yogurt
# I did knock it over I'm sorry
# you can fix it after breakfast
# there's some stems in here Baby_oh so we can get rid of the stems if you like
# and that green one you don't want to eat though
# that's not ripe
# but you can eat the rest
# mhm well all you really need to do is take the stems off
# you pinch the stems off like that
# and then you can eat the berries
# and that way you have more berries to eat
# you don't want to throw away the berries
# oh you don't want to throw away good berries when you could eat them
# that would be a waste of good blueberries
# especially these blueberries which are delicious
# we should &-uh
# I wonder if a little boy or a little girl picked these blueberries
# hm I think it was a little boy who put them out
# I saw a little boy putting them out
# uhoh
# we bought them on the road Naima
# when we went to Machaias
# oh you wanna look yourself
# okay
# Daddy will
# hm this has not been
# refrigerated
# what's that
# this blueberry jam has not been refrigerated
# 0it should be okay
# I guess but I'm gonna put it in the fridge now
# &-um what was I thinking
# oh we should &-um
# we should try to visit the organic blueberry farm down the road
# is it on
# it is on the way to Cobb's Cook isn't it
# &-uh no
# or is it
# no
# it's on the way to Machaias
# oh that's right
# because otherwise we should call Gramps'
# and give them a little heads
# if we're gonna do that
# maybe we should
# I think we should call Gramps'
# it's a working day Tuesday
# yeah
# so
# the only issues are whether Grandma's going on a cross
# I wonder if he's
# well and I wonder if they're at the Blue Hill Fair
# oh
# marketing or anything
# I suppose so
# we can give 'em a call
# which starts tonight actually as far as I can tell
# well
# so
# well if the weather's as good maybe we should take the trip
# the proble
# Sunday
# to
# Blue Hill Fair from
# oh y'know it would make a lot more sense to get the blueberries except we'll have_to buy
# keep buying ice
# from
# and pick it up there
# no I really would prefer Tuesday
# but
# 'cause Gramps' Farm is out of the way
# but we're not
# I know
# compared to Blue Hill
# I mean
# well they're both
# I mean
# Gramps' Farm is less out of the way than the Blue Hill Fair is
# &-uh yeah but I think that trip to the Blue Hill Fair would be &-uh
# right
# good for other reasons
# right but I'm just saying in terms of
# and icebox versus taking the side trip to Gramps' Farm on the way home I'd prefer to take the side trip to Gramps' Farm
# oh it's not the
# yeah well it does
# it's still a problem in terms of the timing of the trip
# why
# 'cause we're gonna be under a lot of pressure to get
# I know but
# yeah
# from Skudick
# is that a reasonable stop
# that's a very reasonable stop in fact it's almost an ideal stop it's about an hour and a half
# okay well
# actually maybe not
# maybe an hour but still
# is that a good breakfast Naima
# yeah
# how is that jam
# I haven't had any
# it's good
# very blueberry_y
# not overly sweet
# we could read that after breakfast
# well I'm not gonna read it 'cause I'm eating my breakfast
# and I'm gonna eat some cereal now so I
# I'm not gonna read it
# we'll read it to you as s
# really soon as soon as we finish breakfast
# you wanna talk about what's in that book
# yeah
# Sal and her mother take some pails
# why do they want to
# why does the moth
# her mother want to pick blueberries
# that's right
# her mother wants to can blueberries for next winter
# that means
# I know it probably sounds like it means put them in cans but it means put them in jars
# like to make jam
# yeah
# on the stove and put it in jars and then store it keep it so that they will have blueberries all year round
# we do that too except we put the blueberries in the freezer
# so we have them all year round
# almost all year round
# so Naima gets to eat frozen blueberries
# all year round
# this is the time of year when people who have blueberry fields pick their blueberries
# in fact that's probably a reason why they aren't at the Blue Hill Fair because 'cause it's probably peak time for picking
# yeah
# or maybe
# oh little Sal finds mother crow and her children
# little bear finds a mother partridge I think you're right
# there are a lot of mothers and children in that book don't you think
# mother
# Sal's mother and Sal
# the mother bear and little bear
# and the mother partridge and the mother crow
# and their children
# I think that's all
# who else
# Little Bear are you eating your blueberries
# gesundheit
# gesundheit gesundheit
# for two sneezes
# oop
# you need your spoon
# I'll wash it
# kiwi seeds
# &-um y'know I could take her cottage garden this morning if you wanna have a little reading morning for yourself and then we could do
# yeah that's
# we could do Cobb's Cook in the afternoon
# I just wanna take a shower before I go out but
# you wanna go on a hike this morning Naima
# you wanna go on a hike with Mommy
# and look at flowers and things like that
# doesn't that sound like fun
# hm
# sour yogurt
# are you gonna eat some
# all that
# mhm
# oop
# I think you dropped some blueberries out of the spoon
# can you pick up the ones that're on the mat now and put them
# Naima you know what you're doing now
# you're making a mess
# I'd like you to pick up the blueberries which are perfectly good to eat over here and either eat them or put them in your yogurt
# and that goes for these over here too
# these ones
# pick them up and put them in the yogurt or eat them okay
# good
# there's some more though
# over here
# this is just some diapers that are on a rinse cycle I think when they're done when they start spinning I'm gonna jump in the shower
# mhm
# take a shower
# thank you for cleaning up those blueberries now you can eat them
# in fact
# are you going a
# for a hike with Mommy
# to the to the cottage garden
# yeah that's where we're gonna do our hiking
# we can be bears
# in the woods
# I wonder if I should bring the
# huh
# it's a little hard to do it if
# just one person
# you would like to hike on your own just walking wouldn't you
# and if you wear sneakers then you'll have more traction and you won't slip
# mm
# like you did yesterday
# when we were hiking and you had sandals on
# remember
# that was a nice hike we did
# is something in your mouth
# blueberry skin
# mm I like that honey
# oh is that the first time you're having the honey
# no but I like
# oh but it is nice it has a nice flavor
# 0remember where we used to get crystallized honey all the time
# I also like the texture 'cause it's semi_crystallized
# mhm
# yep
# 0it 0would be nice to &-uh
# 0it 0would be nice to maybe bring back home some blueberry honey
# you can't really get it on the Cape
# mm
# we could maybe get a bigger thing or
# I think I got that in Eastport
# in Eastport
# yeah
# but there must be
# y'know
# 0it must be all over
# what did you say Naima about Blueberries For Sal
# oh
# kaplink kaplank kerplunk
# what's that
# mhm
# then there was mother bear and little bear walking along
# they were munching
# munching berries and swallowing them
# getting fat for the winter
# 'cause bears sleep the whole winter
# did you know that
# they sleep the whole winter
# and so they need to eat a lot of food before they go to sleep just like you need to eat a lot of
# mm
# bears sleep all winter
# they sleep for days and days and
# they sleep all winter because
# they get tired
# that's a good question
# well 'cause they're tired I guess
# 'cause they
# they don't like to waste any time
# they sleep
# that's a good question
# I think because she heard him outside when he was going
# and that
# she was lying in bed
# when she heard that sound outside her window
# so she realized that she'd better do something or else she's not gonna sleep all night 'cause she'll be listening to the bear going
# that bear had a bad toothache
# I guess he didn't brush his teeth regularly
# that's why
# so she invited him in 'cause she wanted to help him so that he wouldn't have a toothache so he wouldn't be making so much noise all night so she could go to sleep
# I think that's really why she helped him
# and maybe she helped him because she didn't like hearing him suffer and be so miserable
# maybe she wanted to make him feel better just so he would feel better
# well you know like Daddy said you could pinch the stem off like that and then you could eat the berry
# yes
# did y
# are you eating yogurt too or just blueberries
# yogu
# I haven't seen you eat any yogurt
# 'cause
# you have
# okay
# whatever you say
# why don't you take another bite of yogurt
# &
# please
# please
# oh okay
# Harbour
# &-uh yeah Casko Bay doesn't
# oh it's appealing to me
# really
# well it's a closed privacy
# yes Boo
# I think the tooth was aching 'cause maybe he had cavity and maybe he didn't brush his teeth regularly
# maybe he ate too much honey
# maybe the bear ate
# hey Naima
# Naima
# I said
# yeah you know you're not supposed to do that
# you're making a mess
# you're playing with blueberries and squishing them and making a mess

# too much salmon oh boy
# they do okay
# I didn't know that
# oh d'you think his mommy was giving him bear food like your mommy gives you bear food
# oh

# actually Naima I think it might have been from too much honey
# not too much salmon
# well because sweet things are a little worse for your teeth
# but actually blueberries might be okay
# I wouldn't be surprised if blueberries had things that are good for your teeth in them
# polyphenols
# polyphenols of various kinds

# yes that's a very nice bracelet
# it's a hair elastic bracelet
# well it's a bracelet nevertheless
# you turned it into a bracelet
# 'cause you wanted to
# is Mommy wearing a mic
# yes I'm wearing a mic
# oh
# yes I am
# I'm sure all that noise is really
# what
# I said I'm sure all that noise is really good
# well
# that's just how it goes I'm afraid
# so Miss Boo what else are you eating
# oh Mommy's cleaning up
# she's packing up some stuff
# oh
# is that a
# no it's your feet
# it's numbe
# numbe one and two onto the window
# oh
# one two one two one two
# is that number one two one two one two
# hey there's a fly in this place
# oh what're you doing
# are you gonna
# wave it away
# gonna scare it off
# &-uh y'know that's a bit of a challenge actually
# it's a challenge to
# 'cause flies don't
# they don't like to be herded very well
# they're not like sheep
# sheep you can
# but flies fly wherever they want
# is there a fly on your sippy cup
# no
# oh you're shooing the fly away
# good
# oh I don't think these flies bite
# I got a fly bite today though when we were out at the lighthouse
# that was a
# that was a very pesky Canadian fly and he bit me
# well
# I guess he was hungry
# I don't think he was just trying to be mean and nasty
# he was hungry
# speaking of being hungry Naima what else are you gonna eat
# you gonna eat some more penne pasta
# good
# I think Mommy put some crab salad there too
# there's crab
# you're a lucky king
# is it possible to know which clothes you're gonna wear tomorrow
# yes it is it's gonna be the black cords and the long sleeve black teeshirt
# belts
# actually I don't know if undies are in there
# well I packed
# yeah but you packed three
# who's in the dell
# the zipper in the dell
# the zipper in the dell
# hi ho the zippio
# that's good the zippio the zipper's in the dell
# that's pretty funny
# that's what the
# you did
# what did the rising tide say to Naima
# 'cause that tide was coming up higher higher and higher and higher
# because the tide was coming in
# the water was rising and the water was coming in
# and the water saw Naima and the water said I'm gonna get you
# 'cause the tide was rising
# the tide rises twice a day
# yeah
# twice a day
# that's two times
# why
# the moon pulls the water around
# 'cause the moon
# uhoh another
# is that
# it's probably that same pesky fly
# oh good idea
# shoo it away
# don't worry it's not a big deal Boo
# forget the fly
# it's just a fly
# it's just a fly
# we could open the door and it might fly out but in fact another fly might come in instead so
# yes Boo
# you think we should open the door
# yeah don't worry
# you want to thwack it
# oh dear
# oh dear
# I think that fly flew away
# oh I don't want to be a fly
# oh it's just kinda boring
# it's boring
# Naima you know what
# just forget the fly don't worry about it
# flies aren't that important
# they're just not very important
# &-uh it's not that you can shoo sheep
# I mean you can kind of guide sheep to go to a certain place like you could make sheep go out a certain door but you can't make a fly go out a certain door
# it's much harder
# it takes great skill to herd a fly
# why
# 'cause flies
# oh I got a fly bite because
# that was like
# &-uh I don't know what kind of fly that was
# it was a biting kind of a fly
# it was a Canadian kind of a biting fly
# those were the kind of flies Daddy used to get bit by all through the
# why am I Canadian
# 'cause that's where Babaji and Dadiji went
# they came from India
# they came from India and they went to Canada
# so Daddy's a Canadian
# &
# &
# what's &
# &
# oh
# cats do that don't they
# cats hiss
# that cat was hissing at when the bears came in and ate all the blueberries in that story
# when Bessie Ann
# no
# was it Bessie Ann
# Bessie Allen
# Bessie Allen and the dog and the cat came back into the house and the bears had gone the cat looked at her bowl and she
# just like that
# are you gonna eat some food my dear

# his tree and Kanga says it's her tree
# which doesn't make any sense said Pooh
# because
# he had just come to the bridge
# and he was not looking where he was going
# well he was supposed to be going over a bridge I think but he was not looking where he was going
# don't know actually
# then he tripped over something and the fir cone jerked out of his paw into the river
# he tripped over something
# I don't think we know
# bother said Pooh as it floated under the bridge
# he looked at the river as it slipped slowly away beneath him
# and suddenly there was his fir cone slipping away too
# that's funny said Pooh
# I dropped it on the other side and it came out on this side
# I wonder if it would do it again
# and he went back for more fir cones
# it did
# it kept on doing it
# then he dropped two in at once and leaned over the bridge to see which of them would come out first
# and one of them did
# but as they were both the same size Pooh didn't know if it was the one he wanted to win or the other one
# so the next time he dropped in one big one and one little one
# the big one came out first
# which is what he had said it would do
# and the little one came out last which was what he had said it would do
# so he had won twice
# and when he went home for tea he had won thirty six and lost twenty eight
# which meant that he was
# well
# I guess twenty eight times he got it wrong and thirty six times he got it right
# which meant that he was
# well you take twenty eight from thirty six and that's what he was
# instead of the other way around

# hm oh that must be the hospital building
# that's what that is
# mm what's that
# where
# yeah
# and what's that
# here's it is kind of it's a helicopter that works like an ambulance it also brings people to the hospital but brings them in the air
# Gospal in the hospital
# last year I was Gospal the dog walker
# when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs
# and guess what I bought with the money they gave me
# a key chain with a little
# what
# race car yes
# what's this thing
# a ramp
# hm I thought it might be Gospal's shadow
# well it's it's got a little key chain with a race car attached to it
# yeah
# ramps don't have ears so it must be his shadow
# every one at school wanted it but it was mine
# I was scared that some one would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew a perfect place to hide it I put the key chain in my
# mouth oh oh
# what happens to him
# he does
# what do you think the teacher is trying to do
# what blue thing
# that's the bench that they're sitting on
# what do you think the teacher is trying to do
# because because he's sick
# he swallowed something
# oh dear
# the teacher called an ambulance
# there it is
# the ambulance people put me on a stretcher they asked me what happen but I still didn't want to tell
# oh see they don't know he swallowed his key chain
# they just know that he's very sick
# it was a little hard to explain why I put a key chain in my mouth
# I hope that you never do anything like that it'll be very bad for you they took me to the hospital what do you see in the hospital here
# mhm
# what do you think that is
# not the red thing see this white thing it's in the room
# that's the special water going into patient's body
# you had some special water going into your body when you were in the hospital remember
# okay what happens next I had a big room all to myself
# the nurse took off my scarf and put a white gown on me
# don't worry she said we'll take a good care of you it wouldn't hurt
# but I was still little scared specially when she took me to the x_ray room
# do you remember getting x_rays
# you might not remember you did get x_rays couple of times
# that's his x_ray and that shows the key chain right in his belly right there
# poor little guy ah
# the doctors asked him to count to ten of course I said
# can you count
# one
# two
# three
# I'm reading the story
# I fell sleep after counting to three and dreamed I was a race car driver
# they were right I didn't feel a thing when I woke up it was already night
# my parents were right there and Mom gave me a great big
# I think you're right
# inside was a race car so big I would never be able to swallow it
# that's the end of the story
# again
# yeah
# I think you might be finished on the potty there
# you do
# did you do more poop in there
# can I look
# you just want me to read the book more but I'll read the book more after you get off the potty
# oh boy
# maybe we should call Daddy and see if he's coming home
# well he wasn't stung by the yellow jackets and that's a good thing because he said he was allergic
# why don't we give Daddy a call
# you wanna take off that sticker
# that's the price sticker
# that's to tell people how much the book cost
# you need your hair elastic fixed
# well that you took off the whole sticker
# that's not a sticker that's the that's printed on the book
# hey do you wanna try to start ah making a new bedtime poster tonight
# we could do that
# yeah you took all the things off of it though so we need to make a new one that says what what we do at night time
# alright one more time and then I think you done on the potty
# I don't think you're peeing or pooping are you
# ah all this is is the title of the book Gospal in the hospital
# last summer I was Gospal the dog dog walker when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs
# and guess what I bought with the money they gave me
# did he buy dog food
# no did he buy did he buy a Chompo bar
# hm did he
# did he buy a tricycle
# oh a key chain with a little race car
# everyone at school wanted it but it was mine
# he's in school he's an animal who goes to school
# I was scared that someone would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew the perfect place to hide it I put the key
# but gulp oh no I swallowed it
# I think he did gulp it
# oh my god
# oh you think he chewed it
# oh maybe he did he definitely swelled though
# suddenly I felt very sick
# he really doesn't feel well
# what happened Gospal said the teacher but I didn't answer I was afraid to tell her about my key
# I think he's may be embarrassed
# well he wishes he hadn't swallowed the key
# she called an ambulance
# the ambulance put me on a stretcher
# this is the stretcher
# they asked me what happened but I still didn't want to tell
# it was a little hard to explain why I put a key
# well that's a good question I don't know I guess may be he thought the other children liked it very much
# they took me to the hospital oh those are the ambulance people
# see there he's on the stretcher they're carrying him in
# ah let see
# this is the special water
# it's a i_v fluid
# called i_v fluid it's also called special water it's something that goes for some people when they are in the hospital they need to get it
# that's a patient
# that's the patient's bed
# yes I think you're right
# the people who go to the hospital usually are sick
# mm
# I was a little scared that's what this page says
# they saw what I swallowed
# well it's no fun to be in the hospital
# they said you wouldn't feel a thing you'll be sleep they gonna go in and take the key
# I fell asleep after counting to three and dreamed I was a race car driver
# they were right I didn't feel a thing when I woke up it was already night
# my parents were right there what's that
# it's a great big package
# it could be a bath tub
# do you think it's a bath tub
# it could be an apple tree
# do you think it's an apple tree
# you're probably right
# it could be ten pairs of pants
# it was a race car
# what a nice present from his parents that's the end of the story
# and I think it's time

# oh I know where you mean
# the I know the bear walk one where we took your shoes off
# that was the Machias play

# it was like bear walking up a hill
# that was in Lubec that play
# okay
# meanwhile he's gonna find the doll
# oh boy does he know that or is it going to be a surprise
# oh Griz you're in for some fun that's such a great play
# the main where we heard the hurdy

# that was at a little shop a little actually a little art gallery and there was a hurdy
# nice musical instrument
# you think Griz would like to listen to that music
# great
# oh
# I'm going to come back and listen after I make my tea I hear the water boiling
# mm
# the raccoon plays the hurdy
# wow
# I can't wait to hear it I'm gonna come listen in just a minute
# Naima we might go in a little while and bring shoes back to her
# well I think we will
# I'm not sure if we're gonna see her though that's the only thing
# 'cause she went somewhere to visit her cousins today
# and I don't know if she'll be back
# by the time we go
# I think we'll go in about a half an hour
# go and bring her shoes back
# 'cause I'm
# because I'm sure she'll want her shoes
# well they're her new shoes I don't think she's even worn them very much
# she went out in the boots that you borrowed
# I mean that you gave her
# those are her boots now
# 'cause they were too small for you you've got
# you've got bigger feet than she has
# oh they're not very small but they're smaller than yours and they just fit those boots perfectly
# would you like a raisin
# mm
# okay let's go hear that hurdy
