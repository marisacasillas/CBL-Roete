# 0i didn't do anything all that exciting
# just visit the library
# that's exciting
# I had a quiet
# Mommy's microphone
# play
# kay ooh clunk
# ooh clunk
# kay
# there you are
# there you are
# okay
# it's  today is June twenty June twenty fifth
# everybody's on
# that's making a good noise
# and I'm gonna test the microphone by clicking the
# c_d player controls
# could hear those very well if this is working
# Naima
# hm see how do I test hers
# do you wanna put on the c_d player
# can you put it on
# no
# okay
# let's see we gotta give her
# play baby
# Mommy will play with you I just wanna get you some crunchy food
# can you come here for a second
# oh that's a bowl
# would you like a crunchy piece of wheat
# no
# shoulda heard that pretty loud if hers is working
# mm kay
# mm
# boy that's stale
# yuck
# mm kay
# okay
# I am testing f one
# if it's working
# you should be able to hear this very clearly
# that was the
# okay I'm gonna shut f one off
# no I'm not I'm gonna leave it on
# turn on f two
# this is a test of the
# I'm close
# I can't play right now because I'm figuring out this equipment
# you've got a nice cup though
# so I'm
# bledder bledder is right
# so I've got it on f one
# I'll try it on f two later
# on the receiver of f one and f two are
# but there is no
# I do not have the transmitter for f two on
# and I'm close to the camera now so I'm gonna walk outside
# this transmitter is working
# cause I'm gonna be talking constantly
# right here
# well and you definitely would not hear me without the microphone here
# so this transmitter itself is not the problem
# if this sound is working
# okay
# and replay that
# okay
# on the receiver
# the f two switch is on off
# rather than on on
# and the other transmitter is still also off so
# you shouldn't be able to hear me
# if I
# if you can hear me now then
# look there's
# hi
# hi
# you gonna open the door for her
# good job
# thank you
# how are you today
# you
# okay tha
# okay this is a test of
# the transmitter which is on f one right now
# and you definitely should not be able to hear this if there's a problem
# now this should be fine cause I just tested it
# this is the one that I thought was not working because it had a new battery
# but I did just change the battery so it has a second new battery which may have been the problem
# and if you can hear this it's definitely fine
# kay now I'm coming back to the camera
# I was in the other room
# and now I put on the one that's on f two
# and walk into the other room
# what is
# if I jiggle the camera a little
# the green lights are on
# okay
# the green lights are now on the receiver
# they were kind of jiggling
# &-um off and on to red
# which is bizarre in and of itself
# it may be a separate problem
# and now with this transmitter on f two
# I'm going to walk away
# and if you can't hear this
# at the same volume right now then
# receiver is not functioning properly
# right
# okay stop
# okay a double test of the hypothesis that the f two channel on the receiver is the malfunction
# I've just switched transmitters
# the one I have I'm putting onto f two
# both green lights on the receiver are on
# they're on green
# and I'm walking into the other room speaking at the same tone of voice
# and you shouldn't be able you should be able to
# sounds like I'm getting louder and louder now then the hypothesis is correct
# okay
# let's find your back
# where is the back
# where's your back
# where

# mm
# the old gray donkey Eeyore stood by himself in a thistly corner of the forest
# his front feet well part his head on one side and thought about things
# sometimes he thought sadly to himself
# so when Winnie the Pooh came stomping along Eeyore was very glad to be able to stop thinking for a little
# in order to say how do you do in a gloomy manner to him
# and how are you said Winnie the Pooh
# gloomy
# gloomy
# Eeyore shook his head from side to side not very how he said I don't seem to have felt at all how for a long time
# that is
# Piglet
# and here is
# who's this
# Kanga
# and who's that
# yeah
# dear dear said Pooh I'm sorry about that let's have a look at you

# it isn't there
# are you sure
# well either a tail is there or isn't there you can't make a mistake about it and yours isn't there

# and you know the
# how's doing he's big now
# right I mean
# oh boy
# oh boy oh boy
# when we last saw him he was just a little slip of a thing
# are you still nursing or did you
# &-uh huh
# yeah
# yeah
# yes I do
# yeah
# &-uh huh
# &-uh huh
# yeah
# yeah
# yeah well I'm doing that and she's almost two so
# yeah
# yeah
# well
# I I wasn't gonna force the issue
# &-uh huh
# oh he
# yeah she run
# mhm
# mhm
# mhm
# mhm
# mhm that's good yup
# mhm
# mhm
# mhm
# mhm mhm
# mhm
# yeah yeah
# mhm
# mhm
# mhm
# well it's partly
# it's not completely good or bad it's partly about what your level of tolerance is I mean that
# yeah sure
# no I
# I don't I don't like I don't like it I wish it weren't happening but I'm also not willing to do
# well I mean I am willing to do what it takes to reduce it but not to
# and and I think she
# it is
# but the
# I mean no that's an exaggeration but
# cause sleep is important that's why
# for all of us
# she doesn't have a sleeping problem cause she sleeps right
# I mean she barely wakes up to nurse
# so it's not a question about her not sleeping it's a question about me not sleeping
# no &-um what we did
# is
# so she sleeps on that much of the night
# and she
# so she's farther away from me
# and I either go down to her bed to nurse her
# and and I try to just wait and see if she's really waking up to nurse or not
# you know so
# cause sometimes she'll almost wake up but then she'll go back to sleep without being nursed
# so it's also about listening carefully and waiting
# but anyway sometimes I'll go down to her
# I mean I'm not I I don't feel feel like I have an ideal situation
# can I can I tell you about a book that I like though about this topic &-um
# Elizabeth Pantley is the author
# it's called the no cry sleep solution
# and she is someone who has worked with &-um
# &-um and I I like her approach cause she's kind of like she's kind of like &-um
# well it's hard to describe but you know middle of the
# like if you need to sleep she's got suggestions on what you can do and yet she
# recognizes there are lots_of people like me at least who want like no crying
# but want to sleep
# so it's kinda like way
# like possible ways of making that happen
# and it didn't
# I can't say that
# stuff like that so it's not like you have_to follow a plan
# yeah oh I think she's got some really good ideas and
# apparently I mean
# and I was also on an an email group of people who are following her plan and there's like eight hundred people on the list
# so I don't follow it I mean I kinda like I just kind of abandoned it for the time being but but I but I think a lot of people are actually having success with her method
# and a lot of people aren't too I mean I'd say that it's like one of those things
# so
# Furbur yes
# yeah yeah
# yeah
# and the yeah go back yeah yeah
# yeah
# right
# yup yeah
# mhm think of
# think through what you might wanna do
# mhm
# mhm
# yeah
# yeah
# yeah
# and that's hard for him
# yeah
# yeah oh
# oh I have
# you know that's exactly what has happened to me
# I just started at a certain point I started getting insomnia
# like inability to go back to sleep
# and that just completely complicates things
# and I think it was around when she was age that that was happening to me too
# &-um I can jump to the punch
# unlatch the baby when you're nursing
# him to sleep
# &-um before so that he doesn't actually fall asleep with a nipple in his mouth
# and she's just kind of suggests that you do that religiously and repeatedly
# you know until he kinda unlearns that's the only way he can fall asleep
# yeah
# yeah
# she's not saying that to do that
# yeah sure yeah yeah
# okay now we can read bunny cakes
# now we can read bunny cakes
# bunny cakes
# who's in bunny cakes who's that story about
# Ruby and who else
# yeah
# where's Max in that picture
# he's sitting in a mixing bowl
# silly Max
# ha ha ha
# let see ah we gotta make sure Mommy's your head it's on Mommy's mice
# hm what's he have in his hand
# ha
# that Max
# I can't believe he fits in the mixing bowl is he that little
# he must be little if he fits in a mixing bowl
# this is still March first
# bunny cakes
# oh here's some pictures of things
# what do you see
# yeah those are eggs
# let's count those eggs
# good counting Naima
# one two three four five six eggs
# that is a spoon
# do you see where the mixer is
# does that look like Mommy's mixer
# it's Ruby's yeah that one is Ruby's mixer
# oh cause there's two pictures here
# I see the butter I thought Ruby uses butter to make the cake
# I think that's the butter
# yeah rubber spatula
# I think Ruby uses the rubber spatula to mix the cake
# and she also uses
# the whisk
# and oh there's the flour what's the flour in
# in a red bag isn't it
# with a number two on it
# and I see some measuring spoons
# and a measuring cup
# Mommy has a cup like that
# okay bunny cakes
# it was grandma's birthday Max made her an earth worm what
# no Max said Max's sister Ruby we're gonna make Grandma an angel surprise cake with raspberry fluff icing
# what's he doing there
# it looks like he's using a metal spatula to mix his cake
# which is really just made out of dirt
# that's actually dirt he's pretending to make a cake out of dirt
# okay
# Max wanted to help
# don't touch anything Max said Ruby
# you think she does I think he does want to help Ruby
# does she want him to help
# I don't think she wants him to help
# you think he's gonna touch the eggs
# he might what's Ruby doing with that egg
# she's breaking it into the mixer
# mixing bowl actually she's breaking it into the mixing bowl
# she's holding on to the shells and letting the egg white and the egg yoke going into the bowl
# what she making do you remember
# yeah
# but it was too late oops what happened
# he broke the eggs
# well you can't really fix eggs once you break them
# you have_to throw if you break them and they go on the floor you have_to throw them in the garbage
# maybe maybe Ruby will help Max clean that up and put it in the garbage
# maybe they'll do it together you think so
# yeah maybe Max and Ruby will do that
# Ruby send Max to the store with a list that said
# eggs
# Max waned red hot marshmallow squirters
# for his earth worm cake so he wrote red hot marshmallow squirters on the list
# he wrote it with a red crayon except he's a little bunny and he doesn't really know how to write
# he can't write he's a bunny but he's trying he's trying to write he wants to add red hot marshmallows squirters to the list so the grocer will give them to him
# that's a kind of candy
# the grocer could not read Max's writing
# eggs said the grocer and he gave Max eggs
# Max brought the eggs home to Ruby
# oh I think they're in that red box
# don't bump the table Max but it was too late
# what happened
# he spilled the milk
# yeah
# she said don't bump the table Max but he did bump the table you see he's bumping into it right there and the milk bottle is falling over the milk is going on to the floor
# oh oh who do you think is gonna clean that up
# I think she's going to ask Max to help her clean it up don't you think
# when you make a mess you should help clean it up right
# Ruby sent Max back to the store with a list that said
# milk how do you spell milk
# right
# great m i l k spells milk very good Naima
# this time Max wrote red hot marshmallows squirters in a different way
# he really wants that candy
# Max hoped and hoped for his squirters but the grocer still couldn't read Max's writing milk said the grocer and he gave Max milk
# what else is the grocer selling there
# yeah
# and what about over there
# I think those are crackers
# yeah
# Max brought the milk home to Ruby
# what did she do Naima
# what did she draw
# she drew a yellow line on the floor next to the table
# there's a yellow line on the floor Max said Ruby
# you can't step over that line
# I think she's a little bit mad
# he's bringing her the milk
# but Max
# he crossed over the line
# oops what happened
# what did he do
# did he spill
# he spilled the flour
# oh oh over went the flour
# Ruby got out her pencil and she
# over with the flour clonk
# Ruby got out her pencil
# what did she write
# she wrote flour how do you spell flour
# f l o u r
# flour
# this time Max wrote red hot marshmallows squirters in the most beautiful writing he knew
# he's using a crayon isn't he
# Max could almost taste the marshmallows squirters
# flour said the grocer and he gave Max flour
# oh I think Max might be unhappy
# that's the grocer
# the grocer doesn't know that Max wants the candy because he can't read what Max wrote on the list
# Max is just a little guy he doesn't really know how to write or talk properly
# that's the door to the kitchen
# these are trees over here and that's the door to the kitchen and there's Ruby inside holding a spoon
# when Max got home there was a sign on the kitchen door
# Max this kitchen is no place for you said Ruby
# Ruby finished up her cake whose ears do you see outside the window
# those are Max's ears
# Ruby won't let him into the kitchen
# he's outside looking in yeah
# Ruby finished up her cake she baked it and cooled it and iced it with raspberry fluff frosting
# she's using something to put the frosting on the cake
# oh she gave him a spoon of the icing
# he's eating some of the icing just a little spoon full
# he's trying just a little bit
# he's outside the window looking in
# she's using a knife to put the frosting on the cake
# that's a very pink cake
# it needs something else Max said Ruby
# birthday candles silver stars sugar hearts butter cream roses wrote Ruby
# mean while Max had a brand new idea
# he drew a picture of red hot marshmallows squirters on Ruby's list and ran to the grocer
# what's he pulling behind him
# yeah it's a red wagon there
# maybe he's going to carry the food from the grocery store in the wagon when he goes home
# what does the list say
# it says birthday candles silver
# sugar
# and butter cream
# and what're those
# he drew a picture of red hot marshmallows squirters
# on Ruby's list and ran to the grocer he could not wait
# well he won't have_to wait too long
# birthday candles silver stars sugar hearts butter cream roses said the grocer what's this why it must be a red hot marshmallow
# squirters
# Ruby's cake looked just beautiful
# Max went out and put caterpillar icing on his birthday cake
# on his on his earth worm cake
# what's he doing what's he having in his hand
# what's he doing with the knife
# he's putting caterpillar icing on the cake with his knife
# Grandma was so thrilled she didn't know which cake to eat first

# isn't it beautiful Max said Ruby
# thirsty said Max
# you may buy a very very small lemonade Max said Ruby what's she giving him now
# she's giving him her wallet do you think that's a good idea
# next door in Candy's corner window were hundreds of vampire teeth
# Max knew grandma would love a set of teeth with oozing cherry syrup inside for her birthday
# okay
# he bought them instead of the lemonade
# two dollars please said Candy
# Max wanted to make sure the teeth worked he put them in the teeth worked perfectly and Ruby had to take Max to the laundromat what're they gonna do with the laundromat
# what're they gonna do what's this
# a washing machine
# and what's Ruby doing over here this is Max
# this is Ruby's hand
# I think Ruby is cleaning off his face with a washcloth
# because he has mess on his face
# soap cost a dollar the washer cost a dollar and the dryer cost another dollar
# money down the drain Max said Ruby
# hungry said Max
# it was lunch
# Max finished off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich two coconut cup cakes and a banana shake lunch costs four dollars one two three four
# what does she have left in her wallet
# yeah
# money is running through our fingers Max said Ruby
# they walked all the way back to Roselinda's gift shop without spending another penny
# oh now what's happening in this picture
# well Roselinda is telling Ruby that the music box costs a hundred dollars
# but she doesn't have that much she only has a five dollar bill
# and Roselinda shows her the blue bird earrings that play oh what a beautiful morning
# they are on sale for four dollars
# we'll take them said Ruby she's gonna buy those earrings for her grandma

# it is the wallet is empty there's no more money in it
# Roselinda gives Max the change you take care of this dollar young man

# I think it's a duck lion
# could we call it
# could we call it Lionel
# that could be the duck's name
# Lionel
# or do you wanna give the duck a different name
# Koalaba
# I think I'll rewind this a bit to double check it

# oh_my_goodness is Arthur gonna baby
# that means he's gonna take care of those children
# Arthur is here walking past his friends
# he's telling them I'm going to take care of those twins
# who is that
# what kind of ears does that animal have
# what kind of animal is that
# is it a rabbit
# oh let's see what's happening in this picture
# oh_my_goodness
# that baby's diaper is leaking
# you can see the drops of pee
# and Arthur is
# Arthur's pants got all wet
# yeah I think that baby's diaper is leaking
# he needs a new diaper
# I think the baby is crying
# and that's D_W
# she's crying in that picture
# and what's happening in that picture
# that baby's throwing up
# remember you threw up when you were sick
# I think she is sick
# she's throwing up some green stuff that came out of her tummy
# that's what happened to you when you were sick
# you were throwing up also
# yeah sometimes it was orange
# that's what the baby's throwing up
# cause she's sick she needs to have some medicine maybe
# and here's a picture of Arthur and his sister D_W
# she's jumping on the sofa
# Arthur's trying to read a book
# his sister's making a lot of noise
# that's Mrs Tibble
# she has to go out
# the cat looks like she's hiding
# yup she might
# well D_W's not in this picture
# there's D_W
# okay you wanna look at this page
# D_W's jumping on the sofa
# that's Arthur who's holding the crying baby
# that's his sister I think
# oh she's having pee
# it's leaking
# she needs her diaper changed
# Arthur has to change her now
# she's throwing up
# that's Arthur
# he's saying yuck
# let's see what happens next
# those children are playing very rambunctiously
# yes Arthur is holding the throwing up baby
# Arthur's holding the baby who is throwing up
# I think maybe he's trying to help her feel better
# hm I wonder where Daddy is
# he was supposed to come home
# maybe he's reading his paper at work
# that's D_W
# she's crying
# her overalls
# she's wearing a dress that looks like overalls
# what is she doing
# she's laughing
# there's all of Arthur's friends
# are you saying to Mommy to read some
# Arthur remembered what that was like
# now he was really worried
# there I read it
# I think that that
# can you read the letters there on that book that D_W was reading
# what letters are those
# can you see them
# oh you wanna talk about that picture with the babies throwing up
# do you think Arthur might give her some medicine to help her feel better
# yeah
# there he is
# he's her big brother
# do you want me to talk about that picture
# that's the picture where the baby's diaper is leaking and Arthur's pants are getting wet
# see how the pants are dark on his thighs
# that means the baby's diaper leaked
# the baby's diaper leaked and made Arthur's pants all wet
# I think he probably will get another diaper for that baby
# and he will probably also change his pants
# what thing away
# those green things are the throw up that is coming out of the baby's mouth
# oh you think he'll clean it up
# yeah you're right
# he'll probably clean it up
# he'll probably get a wet rag and clean it off of this chair
# clean the green throw up off of the chair
# and then put the rag in the laundry or throw it away
# I think he will because he's the one who's taking care of the baby
# when you're taking care of someone who's sick you do that kind of thing
# you clean up the throw up and stuff like that
# she is throwing up
# I bet she doesn't feel good
# she probably feels lousy
# I'm so glad you're better though Naima
# Naima is all better
# what happened with the nurses
# in the hospital
# they did a lot of things to take care of you
# well
# they put a special bangle on your arm which had blue tape on it
# and they connected a hose to your hand
# so that you could get the medicine that you needed
# they checked to make sure you had enough medicine
# well they took your temperature
# by sticking that thermometer in your ear
# they took your temperature
# they listened to your chest with a stethoscope
# one of the nurses gave you a grizzly
# it was Janet who gave you the grizzly
# I think Barbara did take off the blue bangle
# which was like a bandage
# she took off the blue sticky tape that was on your arm
# she took out the needle
# there was a needle
# she took it all off
# oh and you had a bangle on your ankle also
# that's right and she took that off
# I think that had your name on it
# you had that bangle on your ankle too
# I forgot that
# and you had some kind of a special night
# what was it
# what was on it
# was it bears
# what was on the night
# &-uh
# I think maybe it was little bears
# little pink bears
# and
# mm
# oh you're right it was elephants
# you had the special elephant night
# and there was a special crib there
# do you remember that crib
# and Mommy slept next to you
# on that chair
# next to your crib right
# and Mommy nursed you too to help you feel better
# remember
# you were sick yeah
# well &-um
# the book fell down that was on my lap
# the nurses brought food for Mommy to eat
# they took away your diapers after I changed you and they weighed them
# on a scale
# a scale is for finding out how heavy something is
# it measures how heavy something is
# we weighed Naima too
# we weighed you
# you weighed twenty five pounds
# again
# we already talked about it

# &-uh
# yes
# and I don't know you know what the solution is
# obviously these guys are in a rush
# yeah
# well I can call and just mention it to them at least
# so that it doesn't go completely &-um
# you know
# looks like you're outta food there
# do you want something else to eat Naima
# whatd'ya think
# I don't think that we're out of it but I do think that you could have something else
# like
# raisins
# or what else
# is that what it feels like
# your hair was a little outta control there
# how bout some bread with
# oh how bout some bear food Naima
# are you a bear cub that wants to eat bear food
# or you could have some egg yolk
# I'm the mommy bear
# and you're the baby bear
# Poppa_Bear
# the story of Goldilocks
# I need to tell you that while you're eating
# what are you gonna eat
# you're gonna have some fresh grated apple
# does that sound good
# I can do that but what are you gonna eat while I'm telling it to you
# I will tell it to you but you've got_to be eating something
# okay
# it's a deal egg yolk and egg white
# yes
# good idea Naima
# first I'm gonna take the shell off of the egg
# mhm
# cause we don't eat the shell with the eggs
# how do you spell egg
# it does have a g in it
# egg is spelled
# e g g
# this shell does not want to come off this egg
# it's difficult and Mommy's having a tough time with this egg
# you think Daddy will do it if Mommy can't do it
# hm
# while I'm doing it it's just a
# I didn't cook the egg properly
# that's why the shell is sticking to the egg
# like tape
# yes tape sticks to photographs sometimes
# especially in the book we made for you called Naima's journeys right
# is that what you're thinking of
# alright let's see here
# let's slice this egg for you
# should we get a plate maybe
# what color plate's that
# here's some egg white
# here's some egg yolk
# mm big chunks of egg yolk
# they look like chunks of cheese
# go head and eat some and I'll tell you the story of Goldilocks
# once upon a time there was a little girl who went on a walk in the
# forest
# she saw a snake
# you like that variation don't you
# she saw a snake
# she saw a robin
# she saw a badger
# she liked walking in the forest
# so that she could see all the different animals
# she was having fun but she was walking for a long time
# and then she got tired
# and she first she found the house
# a house up ahead
# she was hungry and tired
# so first she decided to knock on the door
# knock knock knock
# but there was no answer
# so she walked in the house
# and then what happens next
# what does she
# she wants to find the bears
# what does she see when she walks in the house
# three chairs yes three rocking chairs
# a big one
# a medium sized one
# and a little one
# and then
# she sat in the biggest rocking chair
# and she started to rock and rock
# but then she stopped
# and she said this rocking chair is too
# fast
# so she climbed out of that rocking chair
# she got into the next rocking chair and that was the medium sized rocking chair
# and she rocked
# and she stopped and she said
# wait a minute this rocking chair is too what
# slow
# so what did she do
# she climbed out of that rocking chair
# and
# she climbed into the little rocking chair
# and she rocked
# and she said oh hey
# I like this rocking chair
# it's just right for me
# and then what happens
# she's rocking in that little rocking chair for a long time right
# she rock and she rocked
# until it broke into bits
# right
# and then what happens
# she wants to fix it
# well she's a little girl she doesn't really have access to tools and screws
# and she's in somebody else's house
# she doesn't know where they keep their tools so she can't fix it
# so she goes into the kitchen because she's hungry
# I think you're right Naima
# I'm slicing a bagel
# cause that's what I'm going to eat for breakfast
# a bagel's like an o isn't it
# so she goes into the kitchen and she sees
# what does she see on the table there
# yes
# three bowls of porridge
# and one of them is big
# and one of them is medium sized
# and one of them is
# little
# she sits down in front of the big bowl of porridge and she takes a bite of it
# she says
# oh this porridge is too hot
# she needs to cool it down
# then she goes over to the medium sized bowl of porridge and she takes a bite
# she makes a face like this
# then she says this porridge is too cold
# so she gets down outta that chair
# she goes to the littlest bowl of porridge
# she takes the spoon dips it in the porridge then sticks it in her mouth and takes a bite
# and that porridge was just right
# that's right Naima you know this story don't you
# where's Mommy's coffee
# and
# and then she keeps eating the little bowl of porridge
# and she eats and eats
# until what happens
# she finishes it
# that's right til it's all gone
# and then she wants to wash her bowl off
# okay and so then she takes the bowl and she takes it over to the sink
# she puts some soap on it and she uses a sponge
# and she washes off the bowl until it's all clean
# it might've been that she wanted to dry the bowl
# and cook more porridge what a good idea
# mommy bear
# is Goldilocks mommy bear
# I don't think so
# she's in the bears' house though
# she's in the bears' house
# she washes the bowl and she puts it back
# she doesn't cook more porridge I don't think so
# not in this story anyway
# she's tired right
# so she should find a bed to sleep in
# she goes upstairs and she climbs into the biggest bed that she sees
# and she tries to get comfortable
# and she says &-uh wait a minute this bed is too hard
# she can't get comfy it's not a comfy bed for her
# and then what happens
# and then she climbs out of that bed and goes into the medium sized bed
# she tries to get comfortable
# I can't get comfortable
# she says this bed is too soft it's like sleeping on a big fluffy pillow
# and then she gets out of the medium sized bed and she goes over to the littlest bed of all
# what happens
# she's in the littlest bed and she says mm oh this is so comfy
# this bed is just right
# and she falls asleep
# the medium sized bed is the one that's too soft
# the littlest bed the little bed that's right
# the little bed is the one that is very very comfy
# she falls asleep
# and pretty soon what happens
# the bears come home to their house
# they walk in the door they want to rock in their chairs
# they go into the living room and papa bear sits in his chair and he starts to rock
# and he rocks a couple of times and then he stops
# and he says somebody's been rocking in my chair
# he's very puzzled
# I think you're right
# I think Goldilocks has been rocking in the Poppa_Bear's chair
# and then
# and the mama bear goes and sits in her chair
# right
# she starts to rock and what does she say
# she says somebody's been rocking in my chair too
# mhm I think you're right
# yes Goldilocks is still sleeping upstairs at this point
# and then the baby bear goes over and
# there's a bird over at the feeder Naima
# birds are coming to eat
# can you see them
# there's a lot of sun in this room
# there now you're out of the sun
# can you see the birds
# oh maybe they'll come back
# you rearranging your cups
# hey you ate a lot of that egg good job
# what else would you like to eat
# sesame
# okay let me find the sesame for you
# would you like a pile of sesame right here
# here's a pile
# well I forgot to buy jam at the store yesterday
# we're almost out of strawberry jam
# what else would you
# you're eating the sesame is it good
# good
# do you wanna eat some apple
# I'll get you some apple
# you want bread and jam
# you can have some of my bagel
# there's no more jam right now
# do you want apple
# okay
# you want some plain bagel
# I think there's
# what happened to that
# &-uh yeah you can have some of my plain bagel
# let's see here
# this is Mommy's plain bagel
# and I can get you some apple sauce
# oh yeah the other part of the story &
# where did we leave off
# the baby bear looked at his rocking chair
# and it was broken
# and he said someone's been rocking in my rocking chair and they broke it
# ugh he was kinda mad I think
# so then
# mama bear said don't worry we'll fix it
# and then where do the bears go
# into the kitchen
# cause they're hungry
# they've been out walking so they're hungry too just like Goldilocks was
# when you walk for awhile you get hungry
# they've been walking for a long time
# &-um so the papa bear looked at his bowl he didn't even have_to take a bite
# he just looked at his bowl and said somebody's been eating my porridge
# oh no there's an uhoh here
# yes I think Goldilocks was the one eating his porridge
# I hope your elbow hasn't been in the way over here
# let's attach this over here
# and then the mama bear also says
# somebody's been eating my porridge too
# I think you're right
# and the baby bear looks at his bowl which is completely clean remember because she washed it out this time
# and he says somebody's been eating my porridge
# and she ate it all up
# she washed out the bowl and it's completely empty
# I think maybe the baby bear starts to cry at this point
# do you think so
# and the papa bear says don't worry we'll make you some more porridge
# so the bears ate all their porridge
# then when they were done eating they went upstairs to take a nap
# you're having sesame with apple
# who likes the bagel in her porridge
# oh
# she likes bagels with porridge mm
# hm I'm just remembering something
# okay
# they go upstairs and the papa bear says somebody's been sleeping in my bed
# the story of the day
# I'm still telling the Goldilocks story
# you mean you wanna hear what we did yesterday
# okay
# &-um yesterday was Wednesday
# we woke up
# Mommy made coffee
# and in the morning we went out and did errands
# we went to the bank
# we went to the hardware store
# we bought a rake at the hardware store just for you
# and then we went to the
# dry cleaner's
# we stopped in the shoe store for a minute
# we stopped to make sure that your shoes were still the right size
# that was very quick we didn't stay there for very long
# you have cold feet
