# baby kangaroo
# a kangaroo is called a joey when it is a baby
# joey is still only a few months old like all kangaroos he has strong back legs large feet and a long tail
# when joey moves it's easy to see why his legs and body are so big and strong
# he hops
# joey bounces along on his back legs using his tail for balance
# joey finds two other young kangaroos who are awake too
# they start to wrestle each other poking tummies and tugging on ears and tails
# little joey leads the others in a hopping race
# a clucking noise makes him stop suddenly
# it is his mother calling him
# she uses this sound to tell joey that he has wandered too far from her
# joey tur returns to his mother he is very tired now
# he climbs head first into a small pouch on in his mother's tummy
# the baby is the perfect the pouch is the perfect size for her baby
# only joey's legs are sticking out
# then he turns himself around in the pouch so he can see
# a kangaroo's mother's pouch makes a great built
# isn't that a cool idea
# an adult kangaroo stamps its foot on the ground that sound means danger
# joey's mother lifts her head and sniffs the air
# suddenly a dingo dog comes running from the trees
# the kangaroos must escape
# they jump away flying through the air
# joey ducks down into his mother's pouch his mother has never moved so fast
# mother kangaroo jumps fast and far
# the pack of dingo dogs can't keep up
# soon the dingos drop back
# the kangaroos are safe but they keep on moving
# they are heading toward a patch of rain clouds
# the kangaroos know that tasty green grass grows wherever rain has fallen
# the group reaches its new home before dark
# kangaroos settle into their new home
# night is coming and it is getting cooler
# joey and the other kangaroos will spend the evening feeding
# joey's mother nibbles grass she uses her short front arms and big back feet to hop step forward
# joey is still in her pouch he stretches down to eat some grass too
# joey's little tummy is full now joey leaves his mother's pouch
# it is grooming time
# he uses a paw to comb the fur on his legs
# his arms tummy chest back and floppy ears
# he licks his arm and rubs him all over his face
# grooming keeps joey clean and keeps the biting bugs away
# when joey is finished grooming he looks for a playmate
# joey hops to a pool filled with fresh rain water
# the pool is new to him
# the land where he lives is normally very dry
# joey looks into the water he sees another kangaroo looking back at him
# who is it
# do you know
# he saw him in the water
# he was looking in water
# and you know what he actually saw his reflection it's like a mirror he only he only saw himself
# but he thought it was another kangaroo
# joey leans closer to look in the water at the stranger's face
# oops joey dips his nose in the water and gets all wet
# the water feels wonderful joey hops right into the puddle
# soon other young kangaroos join him there
# they discover what older kangaroos already know
# water is fun
# wanna see all the footprints
# see these ones here
# see if you can find those in these
# in this circle of different ones
# yep
# good
# this footprint is very big

# right
# which one this the one about the owl
# alright and then I gotta fill the clothes okay
# okay
# the long winter snow is just beginning to melt away as mother snowy owl scrapes a shell or nest on top of a very small hill
# yyy in spring it is cold on the arctic tundra
# the ground is still wet so mother owl lines the nest with moss and feathers
# she settles into the nest and she calls to father snowy owl
# mother owl lays a glossy white roundish egg in the nest and sits on top of it
# sharing the warmth of her body with the egg
# father owl brings a lemming for her to eat so she doesn't have_to leave the nest
# the next day mother owl lays another white egg and two days after that another
# until there are eight eggs in the nest
# the spring's wildflowers bloom bright as mother owl sits patiently on the nest
# she and father owl call to each other to keep in touch
# as the long spring days pass father owl makes many flights to hunt for lemmings and hares
# he flies swiftly and silently
# father owl brings back meals caught in his sharp claws
# finally the first tiny owlet hatches out of the first egg laid by mother owl
# baby snow is covered with soft white down
# as soon as snowy is able to eat father and mother owl feed him tender bits they have stored nearby
# the next day another owlet hatches
# after seven days snowy has seven brothers and sisters
# can you see the one with his eyes open that's snowy which one has his eyes open
# right
# a caribou wanders too close to the nest mother and father owl shrill to drive him off
# snowy owl tries his hardest to
# the caribou looks up from his grazing when the caribou turns and wanders away from the nest
# father owl calls out a loud hoo hoo
# snowy and the rest of the owlets are growing bigger every day
# mother owl no longer covers them in the nest
# mother owl stands guard near the nest while father owl searches for a hare to
# feed the large family
# during the mid summer when the arctic nights are as light as day snowy steps out of the nest and spreads his wings
# snowy strides down the small hill he is the first owlet in the family to climb over the rocks
# and walk through all of the wildflowers through the nest
# he sees a snow goose gliding above him
# snowy is so happy he hoots
# mother owl and the owlets look over from the nest
# to make sure snowy is safe
# snowy spends many hours exploring the tundra around the nest
# day by day his brothers and sisters become explorers too
# as they grow old enough to leave the nest
# look at him
# is he cute
# now can you remember any of these
# which one's snowy owl
# which one's snowy owl
# yep little wizard yep

# read your books with mommy
# it was morning in the jungle
# steam rises up from the ground jungle sparkle with dew
# monkeys and birds chatter in the tree tops
# it's a morning just like any other or is it
# look three tiger cubs come tumbling out of their dark cave today is their first day outdoors they are eight weeks old and ready to explore
# the bright sun makes the cubs blink
# their eyes are used to the darkness of the cave
# a monkey screams and two cubs scramble for cover
# the third cub is smaller but much braver than her brothers
# she looks for the monkey
# her name is tiny tiger
# one day she will grow up to be a beautiful tigress
# a low grunting sound brings all three cubs running
# the cubs know the familiar sound of their mother's voice
# tiny tiger and her brothers follow mother tiger through the tall jungle grass
# their stripes hide them very well
# to other animals they looks like swaying grasses filled with shadows and sunlight
# tiny tiger is amazed by the world around her there is so much to see smell and hear
# tiny tiger sees her mother's long tail swing
# she tries to catch it
# mother holds her tail high out of her baby's reach
# tiny tiger turns to chase her own tail round in circles she goes
# her mother grunts softly
# keep moving
# the tiger family comes upon a small lake
# it is quiet cool and shady
# perfect for the hot tigers
# first mother tiger checks the area for danger
# no jackals or jaguars just a few harmless little birds
# the three young tigers have never been swimming
# like all tigers the three cubs love water
# they march right in
# the little cubs rustle and tumble by the cool jungle lake
# tiny tiger sees a peacock
# she takes a few steps toward the beautiful bird
# it flies away
# tiny tiger thinks the peacock is afraid of her
# she is wrong
# the bird has seen something in the large grass
# suddenly a loud roar freezes tiny tiger in her tracks
# there's another tiger here
# the cubs run and hide behind her mother
# mother tiger is not scared because she knows this visitor
# he is father tiger
# they rub necks to say hello
# tiny tiger bravely jumps from behind her mother
# she grows a baby growl
# her father gently rubs her with his big paw before going on his way
# tiny tiger is a playful cub
# she creeps slowly and quietly to practice hunting
# her little body stays low to the ground and her ears press flat against her head
# suddenly she jumps
# she has caught a peacock feather
# one day tiny tiger will catch real food
# today it's just for fun though
# her brother chases her trying to steal her prize
# the family returns home for a short nap
# the cubs cuddle together under their cave
# mother tiger washes each of the three cubs with her rough tongue
# then she lies down with him to rest
# after her nap mother tiger hunts for food for her little cubs
# she leaves them safely napping near the cave
# tiny tiger's legs kick as she sleeps
# she flicks her tail and growls softly
# she dreams of the day when she will grow up to roam the jungle as a mighty tigress
# she will grow up to be her
# like her mama won't she
# hm
# whose tracks are these
# do you know any of these tracks
# I know some
# tell me which ones you know

# but that one's about drawing this one isn't a story
# 0it is about drawing
# do you wanna read about
# let's see
# Peter's chair
# or
# Harold circus
# how bout Harold circus
# okay
# and then we gotta find more stuff for the yard sale after this okay
# Harold's circus
# one evening mainly to prove to himself he could do it Harold went for a walk on a tightrope
# he made sure the rope was drawn tight and straight so it wouldn't sway
# he skipped lightly across and finding it fun to be a tightrope walker high about the rest of the circus
# he stayed upon the rope with the greatest of ease until he lost his balance
# it also is easy to fall off a tightrope
# Harold fell twisting and turning with his purple crayon tight in his hands
# by a stroke of luck a comfortable looking curve appeared beneath him
# and he landed on an elephant's trunk
# quite a trick he thought as he rewarded the elephant with a big peanut
# elephants are such tall animals
# Harold was still a long way from the ground
# so he swung down from the elephant's trunk to the neck of a smaller animal
# it was a lovely circus horse beautifully trained and Harold easily put him into a brisk trot
# Harold rode with no saddle in a splendid exhibition of circus riding
# at the finish of his bare back act he leapt gracefully from the horse
# to his embarrassment he fell and turned a rather ridiculous somersault
# before anyone could laugh at the mishap Harold pretended he had been clowning
# he quickly put on a clown's hat
# he put a clown's smile on his face and he acted silly like a clown
# finally he took off the hat and the smile
# and he gave them back to the clown
# the real clown was extremely funny
# and Harold laughed and laughed at him
# this Harold told himself probably was the best circus he had ever seen in his life
# like all circuses it had a fat lady
# she was really amazingly fat
# and of course there was a very tall man
# he was really astoundingly tall
# and next to him was a very small man
# it was another man the lemonade man
# he had a great tank of lemonade
# Harold stopped for a drink of it through a straw
# it was quite refreshing
# he left some money on the counter to pay for the drink and he went on
# looking for the man who was shot out of a cannon
# Harold wasn't what a man who was shot out of a cannon would look like
# but anyway he wasn't there
# though the cannon was nearly ready
# the circus can't wait
# there was only one thing to do the cannon fitted Harold perfectly
# he got into it and he shot out of it
# he went up fast he sailed to the top of the circus where the trapezes are
# and the flying rings
# he reached out he caught on to a flying ring
# he flung far out on it
# he let go doing a startling flip flop in the air and he dived straight down
# he was sure the elephant would be there to catch him again
# once more a reassuring curve appeared beneath him
# but he landed surprisingly hard
# this was no elephant's trunk
# it was the tail of a lion
# somehow a lion had gotten loose in the circus
# before anyone could quite recognize the danger and become alarmed
# Harold was at work getting the lion into a cage
# he got into the cage himself
# with nothing but a lion tamer's chair
# then like the bravest of lion tamers he faced the lion
# with no thought of fear he put his face right in the lion's mouth
# after he took his head out of the lion's mouth it occurred to him that lions had big teeth
# and suddenly he became a bit frightened at how brave he had been
# but his own feelings didn't matter Harold had told himself
# the important thing at a circus is to make the audience happy
# Harold saw that everybody in his audience wore a delighted smile
# naturally making so many people happy made Harold happy
# and he smiled too
# yay they all cheered for Harold
# okay

# yeah
# yeah
# he'll be six yeah in September
# yeah well we don't know
# he's been at the French American school
# for three years
# and his French is amazing
# &-um but the thing with him is &-um
# something about the environment just wasn't working out for him he was getting really stressed about going to school
# the last year and &-um
# I sorta was kicking myself for not keeping im back and I had wanted to keep him back but
# the teachers said oh he you know he's gonna be fine and we just had a bad year last year
# and so I &-um
# I was thinking about possibly putting im in a public school near my house and
# then I just recently sorta had a big panic about it and I went and visited it and I just thought you know I just
# it's just not
# be
# gonna be challenging enough for im
# I know and the more
# I can't even believe that I hadn't considered it when we moved here because
# he is the perfect Montessori kid
# and I hadn't even considered it
# and so I was frantic looking around ya know trying to
# find out about possible openings
# yeah I know
# right
# &-uh huh
# oh
# oh that might be so wonderful
# right
# right
# right
# right
# right
# right
# yeah yeah
# right
# &-uh huh right because of
# right yeah
# he's been in a program
# right exactly
# exactly
# right
# right oh no he's certainly not just
# this child is is a self &-um directed kid and I I honestly
# it just dawned on me about six months ago
# you know
# that that's the way we need to go with him because he he chooses something and he goes with it
# you know whether it's he getting in to
# he's getting into these like &-um
# making all sort of &-um I dunno pulley system things
# I mean he's ya know he's he really gets specific about stuff
# like he's into levers and pulleys and then he's really into the ocean
# and this
# these cope Copipods you know I mean he's like crazy for it and
# right &-uh huh
# &-um I actually have a friend &-um Amy
# who &-um is a good friend of mine and she's actually one of the reasons we moved down to Providence we both lived in Boston
# before
# yeah and she said oh you gotta
# yeah really
# well we had we had talked about &-um
# when we had moved down here ya know school options and stuff and she's the one who showed me the French American school because she speaks French and I was like oh ya know and it was great in the beginning and then she ended up going the Montessori route and &-um
# I've just been you know like I said I've been reconsidering what I'm doing but I would
# obviously I what I want to do is have have him come in and and and have the
# I dunno are you the director
# yeah and and
# right
# oh wow okay
# yeah
# and just have you meet with him and see
# you know I the level the level
# I was planning to put him in kindergarten again this year
# because he's a September eighth birthday
# yeah
# totally
# well that's what I thought but the rea
# the thing was that when we had gone to the &-um
# when I had gone to the public school I was like
# I couldn't I mean the French school was almost way so advanced
# that he'd be going back to
# I mean these kids were doing stuff that he had done
# &-um basically
# yeah he's
# he's reading &-um
# it's called the trials of life
# small words he's
# I don't wanna push him on the reading because he loves to be read to
# those are
# and we're we're reading a ton of chapter books and advanced stuff but when I try ta
# get him to do ya know his hop on pop and all that he doesn't really
# so
# exactly
# yeah he's identifying everything I mean in signs oh this sign says that that says that and
# and in French he's
# amazing as far as he knows all
# a lot of French words that he can just by sight you know identify
# but &-um
# he's
# but I I would say that he's very close I just don't wanna push him in that area because he doesn't seem interested
# with me
# Violet can I give you a kiss good bye
# &-uh he's been going full day
# the last last
# this past year
# the year before he was &-uh five days half days
# love you
