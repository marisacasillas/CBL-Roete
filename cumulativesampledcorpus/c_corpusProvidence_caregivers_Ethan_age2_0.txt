# one winter morning Peter woke up and looked out the window
# snow had fallen during the night
# it covered everything as far as he could see
# after breakfast he put on his snow
# the snow was piled up very high along the street to make a path for walking
# crunch crunch crunch
# his feet sank into the snow
# he walked with his toes pointing out like this
# that's right
# he walked with his toes pointing in like that
# he dragged his feet slowly to make tracks
# and he found something sticking out of the snow that made a new track
# what was it Ethan
# it was a
# stick
# a stick that was just right for smacking a snow covered tree
# then what happened Ethan
# down fell the snow
# plop
# on top of Peter's head
# he thought it would be fun to join the big boys in their snowball fight but he knew he wasn't old enough
# not yet
# so he made a smiling
# what's that
# snowman and he made
# what are those
# angels right
# he pretended he was a
# a mess maker
# no a mountain climber
# he climbed up a great big heaping mountain of snow and slid whoops
# all the way down
# he picked up a handful of snow and another and still another
# he packed it round and firm and put the snowball in his pocket for tomorrow
# then he went into his warm house
# he told his mommy all about his adventures while she took off his wet socks
# and he thought and thought and thought about it
# what's he doing
# before he got into bed he looked in his pocket
# his pocket was empty
# the snowball wasn't there
# he felt very sad
# while he slept he dreamt that the snow had melted all
# sun had melted all the snow away
# but when he woke up his dream was gone
# the snow was still falling everywhere
# new snow was falling
# after breakfast he called to his friend from across the hall and they went out together into the deep deep snow

# dyou remember
# he found a button
# and he pulled it off
# there he is there's a picture of him
# right
# what's he doing
# he lost his button yeah
# Corduroy is a bear
# who once lived in the toy department of a big store
# day after day he waited with all the other animals and dolls for somebody to come along and take him home
# what's there there's a giraffe and a doll
# bunny
# what's that
# yeah it's a clown
# the store was always full of shoppers buying all sort of things
# but noone ever seemed to want a small bear in green overalls
# then one morning a little girl stopped and looked straight into Corduroy's bright eyes
# oh mommy she said look
# there's the very bear I've always wanted
# not today dear her mother sighed
# I've spent too much already
# besides he doesn't look new
# he's lost the button to his overalls
# Corduroy watched them sadly as they walked away
# I didn't know I'd lost a button he said to himself
# tonight I'll go and see if I can find it
# what did he do
# late that evening when all the shoppers had gone and the doors were shut and locked Corduroy climbed carefully down from his shelf and began searching everywhere on the floor for his lost button
# uhoh what's that Ethan
# an escalator
# suddenly he felt the floor moving under him
# quite by accident he had stepped on an escalator and up he went
# could this be a mountain he wondered
# I think I've always wanted to climb a mountain
# is it a mountain Ethan
# no what is it
# yeah it's the escalator
# he stepped off the escalator as it reached the next floor
# and there before his eyes was a most amazing sight
# tables and chairs and lamps and sofas
# and rows and rows of
# beds
# this must be a palace Corduroy gasped
# I guess I've always wanted to live in a palace
# he wandered around admiring the furniture
# Bob wants to read the story
# this must be a bed he said
# I've always wanted to sleep in a bed
# and up he crawled onto the large thick mattress
# all at once he saw something small and round
# what did he think it was
# hm
# what did he think it was
# why there's my button he cried and he tried to pick it up
# but like all the other buttons
# on the mattress it was tied down tight
# and then what happened Ethan
# he yanked and pulled with both paws until
# pop
# off came the button and off the mattress Corduroy toppled
# bang into a lamp
# over it fell with a crash
# yep there's Corduroy
# Corduroy didn't know it but there was someone else awake in the store
# the night watchman was going on his rounds on the floor above
# when he heard the crash he came dashing down the escalator
# now who in the world did that he said
# somebody must be hiding around here
# he flashed his light around sofas and beds until he came to the biggest bed of all
# and there he saw two fuzzy brown ears sticking out from under the cover
# who was it
# who's that hiding
# Corduroy
# hello he said
# how did you get upstairs
# and the watchman tucked Corduroy under his arm and carried him down the escalator
# and put him on a shelf in the toy department with all the other animals and dolls
# what are they doing Ethan
# they're sleeping that's right
# Corduroy was just waking up when the first customers came into the store in the morning
# there looking at him with a wide warm smile was the same girl
# he'd seen only the day before
# I'm Lisa she said and you're going to be my very own bear
# last night I counted
# mhm
# I counted what I saved in my piggy
# do you have a piggy
# yup it's upstairs
# that's right
# and it has lots_of money in it
# and my mother said I could bring you home
# shall I put him in a box for you the sales lady asked
# no thank you
# no thank you said Lisa
# and she carried Corduroy home in her arms
# she ran all the way up four flights of stairs into her family's apartment and straight into her own room
# Corduroy blinked
# there was a chair
# an a dresser
# and next to a girl sized bed
# what was next to a girl sized bed
# yep that's right a little bed just for him
# yup for me
# this must be home he said
# I know I've always wanted a home
# Lisa sat down with Corduroy on her lap and began to sew a button on his overalls
# I like you the way you are she said
# but you'll be more comfortable with your shoulder strap fastened
# you must be a friend said Corduroy

# and Scuffy moved along quickly down the stream down the river
# come back little tugboat come back
# cried the little boy
# not I tooted Scuffy not I
# this is the life for me
# he keeps going
# all that day Scuffy sailed along with the stream
# past cows and women washing clothes
# Scuffy almost got hit by a cow
# that was not fun
# night came and the moon came out
# there was nothing to see but the quiet trees
# suddenly an owl called out
# hoot hoot
# toot toot
# cried the little tugboat
# he was scared
# he wanted to see the man with the polka
# the next morning Scuffy moved on
# he saw two streams
# to make a big river
# Scuffy sailed down the river
# he sailed past villages
# he sailed past men with logs
# what're they doing Ethan
# they're gonna get the logs ready for the logging truck
# this is a fine river said Scuffy but it's very busy and big for me
# he sailed under some bridges
# the river got deeper and wider and now there were big cities
# and big boats
# the river got deeper and deeper and deeper and it moved faster and faster
# then it started to rain and Scuffy was riding on the waves
# up and down
# lots and lots and lots_of rain
# people had to bring cranes and put sand bags by the river
# cause the river was getting bigger and bigger and bigger and higher and higher and higher
# and there's Scuffy all alone
# on went the river to the sea
# at last Scuffy sailed into a big city
# here the river got wider and there were docks and wharves and big ships
# it was a big noisy place
# and cranes loaded freight onto some ships
# Scuffy said toot toot
# but nobody saw him the little tugboat
# oh no said Scuffy when he saw the great big ocean
# there's no beginning and no end to the sea
# I wish I could find the man with the polka
# yup there's a red truck and what's that
# yep it goes all the way to the dock
# just then just as the little red tugboat sailed past the last piece of land a hand reached out
# mm there's a lot of smoke coming out of those ships isn't there
# that's Scuffy again
# he's all by himself
# but look who picked him up
# who picked him up
# the man with the polka
# and he said I wanna go home to the bathtub
# that's just the right size for me
