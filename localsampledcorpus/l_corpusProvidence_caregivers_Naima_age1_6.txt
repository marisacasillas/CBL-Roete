# mostly you
# &-um Mommy carry you she'll say that
# and it's also a transition time cause we're doing lots_of new things and meeting lots_of new people just in the last couple weeks
# because it's the fall and we started new activities like music class and new music class with new kids in it
# we've only been to that twice
