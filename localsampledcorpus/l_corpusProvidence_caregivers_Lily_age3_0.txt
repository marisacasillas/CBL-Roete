# he has an eraser like yours but yours has a little bee on it
# right
# right
# mhm
# right
# hurry he said to his parents I can't be late for school
# Franklin's mother looked at the clock
# even the teacher's not awake she laughed it's too early
# you must be very excited said Franklin's father
# Franklin nodded
# it was so early that there was time to make a big breakfast
# you'll need a full tummy to work at school said Franklin's father
# Franklin wasn't hungry
# I already have a full tummy he said it feels like it's full of jumping frogs
# Franklin's mother gave him a hug
# I felt that way on my first day of too my first day of school too but the funny feeling went away
# Franklin ate a little bit and double checked his book
# finally it was time to go to school
# halfway to the bus
# I don't wanna go he said
# Franklin's father gave him a hug
# that's how I felt when I started school he said but look all your friends are waiting for the bus too
# that's a good question
# is that Beaver's mommy
# no it's not
# ah I dunno it looks a little more like an otter to me than a beaver doesn't it
# yeah let's see
# there were there was a big crowd at the bus
# there were brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers
# Beaver was carrying her favorite book
# I can read it she said
# ah it's Franklin's friend Snail

# Franklin rubbed his tummy
# Rabbit pulled out a brand new notebook
# my big sister showed me how to write my numbers he said
# all of them asked Fox
# most of them boasted Rabbit
# Franklin looked at his mother
# I wanna go home he said
# we'll be here after school to hear all about the things you did today she said
# when the bus arrived Rabbit grabbed his sister's hand and climbed aboard
# Bear stood on the steps and waved goodbye again and again
# Franklin hugged his mother and then his father
# he kept hugging even after his friends had found seats
# as the bus pulled away Franklin looked out the window
# he didn't know if he was ready for school
# do you think the teacher will yell wondered Rabbit who jumped at loud noises
# do you think there's a bathroom asked Beaver fidgeting in her seat
# I hope someone has an extra snack said Bear who had already eaten his
# Franklin didn't say anything
# the bus ride seemed very very long
# oh gosh I wonder
# I wonder who that could be
# maybe
# oh could be the otter you're right
# right
# yeah
# or it could be the raccoon too right
# there's the raccoon
# yeah
# I dunno maybe he was sitting in a different seat
# oh yes
# when they arrived their teacher was waiting
# Mr owl said hello in a gentle voice
# he showed them where to hang their coats and where to sit
# he showed them
# it looks like they're playing with Playdoh
# yeah
# he showed them where to find the bathroom and offered everyone a piece of fruit
# then Beaver and Bear went to the reading and writing center
# Rabbit went to the play kitchen
# but Franklin stayed in his seat
# well we'll have_to ask him
# what would you like to do today Franklin asked Mr owl
# I don't know said Franklin rubbing his tummy
# well he's a lil nervous on his first day of school
# I can't write all the numbers like Rabbit can and I can't read like Beaver can
# Rabbit and Beaver will learn new things at school and so will you
# Franklin started to doodle
# I can see you're a very good artist said Mr Mr owl
# Franklin stood up

# what color is this asked Mr owl holding up a colored pencil
# it's a special blue said Franklin
# it's turquoise
# now you've taught me something said Mr owl
# is there something special you would like to learn
# there were so many things that Franklin wanted to learn that he had trouble deciding
# finally he asked Mr Owl to help him read his favorite book
# he made a building of blocks
# he sorted the money in the classroom store and he painted four pictures
# one for the teacher one for himself and two for his parents
# it was a wonderful day
# Franklin sat at the back of the bus all the way home

# do you want another bandaid

# what do you want
# okay can I finish the book and then I'll go get blankie
# he was so busy having fun he almost forgot to get off at his stop
# his parents were waiting
# how's your tummy they asked
# Franklin looked puzzled it had been such a good day he'd forgot all about his jumpy tummy
# my tummy's empty he said
# well that's a feeling that will go away too said his father
# I made this for you said Franklin's mother and gave him his favorite snack fly pie

# well then we'd have_to cut it out or something
# I know that would that's true but I still don't know if we'd be able to get it out
# Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
# oh great
# you know what
# I love you
# Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
# he could name the months of the year and all the seasons
# he could read the thermometer and he checked the barometer every day
# Franklin worried about the weather because he was afraid of storms
# one day Franklin was supposed to play at fox's house but the sky was getting dark and the clouds were thick
# maybe I shouldn't go Franklin said to his mother
# she looked out the window it probably won't rain until later she said you've got time to get to fox's
# Franklin put on his boots and took the umbrella
# as Franklin hurried to fox's house he kept looking at the sky the clouds moved quickly and the winds swirled dirt in the air
# Franklin felt all jumpy inside
# fox was playing outside when Franklin arrived Franklin pointed nervously to the sky I think we should go inside don't you he asked
# not yet fox grinned I love watching the clouds move and feel the wind blow it's exciting
# I think it's scary said Franklin
# is Franklin a lil scared
# yeah
# beaver snail and hawk came over to play too
# my fur feels funny when it's about to storm said fox
# my feathers get all ruffled said hawk beaver sniffed I can smell a storm coming
# hm who do you think lives in here
# oh snail lives in that little
# I think he does
# that's a cute little house for snail donchou think
# mhm
# the wind became stronger and hawk flew loop
# Franklin held on to his hat and shivered it was almost as dark as night when big fat raindrops began to fall
# we should go in shouted Franklin
# no said fox follow me and they raced to the tree
# do you think that's a good idea to go to the tree
# no
# you could get hurt in a tree
# fox called his mother it's time to come in it's alright said fox we're in the tree
# fox's mother was there in a second it's dangerous to be near a tree during a storm she said
# lighting strikes tall things first and you might get hurt
# right
# you sure were right
# Franklin held on to fox's mother all the way from the tree to the house they were barely in the door when there was a flash of zig_zag light
# lightening shrieked Franklin he trembled
# thunder he screamed
# that's okay Franklin said his friends we're safe here
# but Franklin has crawled deep inside his shell fox's mother brought treats but still Franklin wouldn't come out
# Franklin's friends begged him to play but Franklin stayed put
# then with a flash and a crash the lights went out
# don't worry said fox's mother she lit candles and turned on a flashlight
# won't you come out now she asked Franklin
# no thank you said Franklin
# don't be afraid said hawk all that noise is just cloud giants playing drums in the sky
# Franklin peeked out really he asked
# no it's not giggled snail that noise is when the giants go bowling
# Franklin came out of his shell what about lightening he asked
# oh that's easy said hawk the cloud giants are turning their lights on and off
# fox smiled I think it's the giants swinging from their chandeliers
# Franklin laughed
# giants that's ridiculous said beaver Mister_Owl said that lightening is a big spark of electricity that travels from the sky to the ground
# the spark is so hot it makes the air around it pop and that's the sound of thunder
# amazing said Franklin
# Franklin felt a little better he even played flashlight tag with his friends
# soon there was hardly any lightening the thunder was a low rumble from far away and the rain stopped
# then the lights when on the storms over said fox let's go outside and play
# look said Franklin a rainbow
# I know why the storm is over Franklin said those giants heard there's a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow and they've gone to find it
# even beaver had to smile
# wow
# it sure does
# look at that
# should I make a lil tiny ball
# okay
# looks kind of like a little egg doesn't it

# should we read
# should we read your prehistoric animals
# alrighty
# the prehistoric animals included in this book are just a few of the strange and interesting creatures that once roamed our planet
# huh what's that
# a woolly mammoth
# wow
# sure
# woolly mammoths were a type of prehistoric elephant the woolly mammoth which was distinguished by its long shaggy hair was almost thirteen feet tall
# and appeared about two million years ago during the Ice_Age
# right what was the one that we saw at the Pequot museum remember we saw one
# oh the mastodon
# right
# looks similar
# right
# during the Ice_Age massive ice sheets called glaciers covered vast areas of land
# because it had a thick layer of fat under its skin as well as abundant hair the woolly mammoth managed to keep warm in the year round winter
# crash
# yeah I think so
# the mammoth lost relatively little body heat through it's ears
# boom
# it's ears were very small
# it's long curved tusks enabled it to find food by clearing away snow and ice
# woolly mammoths have been found preserved in the frozen tundra of Siberia
# prehistoric man who probably hunted them for food decorated caves with drawings of these magnificent animals
# wow
# very long
# huh who's this
# the saber
# oh my gosh his tusks are going in his mouth
# wow
# there we go
# the scientific name for the saber tooth tiger is
# does that sound better
# you think Machairodont
# this group included many different kinds of cats all of which had long fangs in their upper jaws
# these cats were carnivores or meat eaters and use their sharp sharp teeth to pierce the thick skins of the plant eating animals
# one of the best know saber
# exact
# yeah Smiladon sounds like mastodon
# they're both Latin names
# hello smarty
# the Machrauchenia
# wow
# Machrauchenia means large throat
# Machrauchenia was a plant eater or an herbivore that
# achoo
# what a long nose he has
# achoo
# the Machrauchenia was about eleven feet tall and was shaped like a camel but with no humps
# fossils show that its nose openings were high up on the skull suggesting that it had some sort of trunk
# it woulduv used its trunk as an elephant does today to obtain food and water
# since each of its toes were hoofed Machrauchenia would've been able to run quickly to escape predators
# huh what's this
# that is the Brontotherium
# &-uh it sounds like a brontosaurus right
# it looks more like what
# what animal does the Brontotherium look like
# kinduv like a hippo kinduv like a rhinoceros
# yeah I think so
# Brontotherium was a plant eater that grew up to eight feet tall
# although it looked like a modern day rhinoceros the two animals are only distantly related
# Brontotherium lived in the warm forest and had a large forked horn on its snout that was shaped like a y do you see its horn
# yeah here's the y shaped one now up here see
# that's his nose
# his snout
# yeah
# okay what comes next
# huh you remember
# right
# wow this is a Thorahockis
# yes
# that one goes
# oh the woolly mammoth
# he goes
# hello I'm a woolly mammoth
# I'm a saber
# I'm a tiger
# you're right
# right I'm a Machrauchenia
# what's that
# that's the Brontotherium
# yes
# hello
# I'm a Brontotherium
# huh
# hello I'm a Thorahockis
# like kkinduv like an ostrich right
# yeah or an emu
# right
# hello I'm a bird
# huh
# hello I'm a giant sloth
# wow that is one big sloth huh
# yeah let's see what it says about the sloth here
# it says the giant sloth was truly huge about twenty feet long from nose to tail
# I'm huge
# let's see this one says we're strange creatures
# the woolly mammoth says I have long tusks and wooly hair
# &-um this one says
# that one says the wooly hair has the woolly mammoth has long shaggy hair and is just thirteen feet tall
# this one says the saber
# this one says the Machrauchenia has a long trunklike nose
# the Brontotherium says that the Brontotherium ate leaves and fruit from the trees
# the Thorahockis says that the birds could not fly they ran on their feet
# mhm
# the Machrauchenia says I have a long nose
# it says that the Machrauchenia was eleven feet tall and looked like a camel with no humps
# the Brontotherium says that they had horns and they used to fight each other with their horns
# this one says that there were lots_of unusual creatures
# it says the woolly mammoth had pretty small ears
# that says that the woolly mammoth lived during the Ice_Age
# it says that one of the saber
# it had long knife like teeth which were over six inches long
# the Machrauchenia says that it ate plants
# mhm
# and a long trunk like nose
# wow
# achoo
# achoo
# the Brontotherium says they had a y shaped forked horn on the top of their snout
# the Thorahockis says it was about five feet tall and had a long neck and small wings
# because the wings were so small they could not use them to fly instead the wings may have helped the bird to maintain balance while it ran on its powerful legs
# yummy
# huh the giant sloth had long curved claws and fed by stripping leaves with its tongue
# but when the giant sloth was on the ground its claws forced the animal to walk on the sides of its feet making movement difficult
# yeah
# although its slow progress made the giant sloth an easy target for meat eaters its claws served as effective weapons
# the giant sloth probably only became extinct about eleven million years ago
# interesting
# mhm
# that is a neat book
# yeah
# well it says that lots_of interesting creatures roamed the earth millions of years ago
# they were the predecessors to lots_of the animals that we see today
# ah the giant sloth
# he says I'm truly huge
# yeah
# huh the woolly mammoth
# saber
# oh no she's not
# the Machrauchenia
# oh my gosh is that a rhinoceros
# the Brontotherium
# oh is that an ostrich
# that's a Thorahockis you're right
# oh my gosh that's truly huge what is it

# you want the tooth fairy book
# look what I found over here though
# the tooth fairy

# I think that's the everything book
# okay well why don't we read the tooth fairy first and then I'll have_to work on digging that other one out
# yeah
# right
# you're right
# this is the tooth fairy
# she has lots_of teeth
# she has lots_of dimes and quarters too
# she needs them because when you are asleep she comes and takes away the tooth that you have put under your pillow
# and she puts the money there instead
# sometimes she forgets and then of course your tooth is still there in the morning instead of the money
# that this is because she works so hard
# the tooth fairy has to work harder than the Easter bunny because the Easter bunny only works on Easter
# the tooth fairy works harder than Santa Claus because there's only one night when Santa goes down all those chimneys but the tooth fairy is busy every night
# that's Santa with a big sack of toys
# if she forgets to take your tooth one night she usually remembers it the next
# she will take your tooth home with her along with all the others she has collected that night
# when she gets home the first thing she does with your teeth is to sort them
# lower teeth extra teeth bottom teeth teeny teeth very clean teeth
# girl's teeth boy's teeth shiny teeth first teeth small teeth
# she puts some of the pretty ones in a glass jar on a high shelf in the kitchen she thinks they look nice there
# they do look nice there don't they
# yeah
# pretty
# she puts some in the bottom of the fish
# she makes some into necklaces and some into bracelets she has more necklaces and bracelets than anyone
# she just loves jewelry
# of course every other fairy knows what kind of birthday presents she will get from the tooth fairy
# the pathway to her house is paved with teeth
# and there are always stars outside her window at night
# at least it looks that way because she has hung clothes
# well it's a pretty decoration I think
# oh really
# thank you
# I do need a little trim
# well we'll just pretend
# snip snip snip
# snip snip snip
# snip snip snip
# how does it look
