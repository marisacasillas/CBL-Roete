# I will never ever not eat a tomato
# I have this lil sister Lola
# she is small and very funny
# sometimes I have_to keep an eye on her and sometimes I have_to give her dinner
# this is difficult because Lola is a very fussy eater
# Lola won't eat carrots of course
# she says carrots are for rabbits
# I say what about peas
# Lola says peas are too small and too green
# one day I played a good trick on her
# yeah
# Lola was sitting at the table waiting for her dinner
# those are oranges
# and I said
# and she said I do not eat peas or carrots or potatoes
# or mushrooms or spaghetti
# or eggs or sausages
# I do not eat cauliflower cabbage or baked beans
# or bananas or oranges
# and I'm not fond of apples rice cheese or fish sticks
# and I absolutely will never not ever eat tomatoes
# my sister hates tomatoes
# and I said this is lucky because we are not going to be having any of those things
# we are not going to eat any peas or carrots or potatoes or mushrooms or spaghetti eggs or sausages
# that's Charlie
# there will be no cauliflower cabbage baked beans bananas or oranges
# and we don't have any apples rice cheese or fish sticks
# and certainly no tomatoes
# Lola looked at the table
# then why are these carrots there Charlie
# I don't ever eat carrots
# and I said oh you think they're carrots but they're not these are orange Twiglets from Jupiter
# what's that
# does that look like the moon to you
# yeah that's Saturn
# that's a planet
# they look just like carrots to me said Lola
# that's a star
# like I wonder if they're confused
# cause it's not a star shape
# ya know
# there's Lola and she's sitting with a green alien
# from Jupiter
# I think
# yeah
# and there's Charlie he's in a spaceship
# how can they be carrots I said
# carrots don't grow in Jupiter
# that's true said Lola
# I might just try one
# if they came all the way from Jupiter
# not bad she said
# and took another bite
# then Lola saw some peas I don't eat peas said Lola
# I said these are not peas of course they're not these are green drops from Greenland
# they're made out of green and they fall from the sky
# but I don't eat green things Lola said
# oh goody then I'll have your share green drops are so incredibly rare
# that's Charlie
# maybe I'll just nibble on one or two she said
# quite tasty
# next Lola saw the potato
# next Lola saw the potato I will not eat potatoes so don't even try not even mashed
# that's a big potato
# oh this isn't mashed potato people often think it is but it's cloud fluff
# cloud fluff from the pointiest peak on Mount Fugi
# oh she said in that case a large helping for me please I love to eat cloud
# that's a mountain
# Mount Fugi
# the Fugi mountain
# that's one tall mountain
# oh

# and I couldn't believe my eyes cause she was pointing at the tomatoes
# that's Charlie

# but at least that takes like half and hour to eat
# as opposed to like
# oh I think you have_to turn it on first honey
# you wanna press the buttons
# you can press this button to
# this is a fit waiting to happen
# she's trying to get that cash draw open
# she's definitely entered the cranky stage cause
# if she finds a toy that frustrates her she picks and and throws it
# she's actually got all her teeth
# she got them all really early
# she hasn't gotten a tooth in gosh I think she got all her teeth my the time she was a year old
# except for her two year molars
# I can't tell whether I've been sticking my fingers in her mouth
# it's hard to get back so far to see if they're coming in
# they're not suppose to come for I guess until she's about two but she got her teeth so early that I'd be surprised if she didn't get these early to
# she got her first two bottom teeth in when she was just three and a half months old

# a green tie right

# instead of greetings students or good morning pupils Mister Slinger winked and said howdy
# he thought desks in rows were old fashioned and boring
# do you rodents thinks you think you can handle a semicircle
# and he was always providing them with tasty snacks
# things that were curly and crunchy and cheesy
# I wanna be a teacher when I grow up said Lilly
# me too said her friends Chester and Wilson and Victor
# at home Lily pretended to be Mister Slinger
# I am the teacher she told her baby brother Julius listen up
# Lilly even wanted her own set of deluxe picture encyclopedias
# whenever the students had free time they were permitted to go to the light bulb lab in the back of the classroom
# they expressed their ideas creatively through drawing and writing
# Lilly went often
# she had a lot of ideas
# she drew pictures of Mister Slinger and wrote stories about him too
# during sharing time Lilly showed her creations to the entire class
# wow said Mister Slinger
# when Mister Slinger had bus duty Lilly stood in line even though she didn't ride the bus
# Lilly raised her hand more than anyone in the class even if she didn't know the answer
# and she volunteered to stay after school to clap erasers
# I wanna be a teacher when I grow up said Lilly
# excellent choice said Mister Slinger
# one Monday morning Lilly came to school especially happy
# she had gone shopping with her Grammy over the weekend
# she had a new pair of movie star sunglasses
# complete with glittery diamonds and a chain like Mister Slinger's
# she had three shiny quarters and best of all she had a brand new purple plastic purse that played a jaunty tune when it was opened
# Lily wanted to show everyone
# not now said Mister Slinger listen to our story
# Lilly had a hard time listening
# she really wanted to show everyone
# what's Mister Slinger doing
# he has a book what's he doing with the book
# really
# Lilly really really wanted to show everyone
# not now said Mister Slinger
# but Lilly couldn't wait
# the glasses were so glittery the quarters were so shiny and the purse played such nice music not to mention how excellent it was for storing school supplies
# look she whispered look everyone look what I've got
# everyone looked including Mister Slinger
# and he was not amused
# I'll just keep your things at my desk until the end of the day he said and then you can take them home
# Lilly's stomach lurched she felt like crying
# that afternoon she went to the light bulb lab she was still very sad
# she thought and thought and thought and then she became angry
# she thought and thought and thought some more and then she became furious and drew a picture of Mister Slinger
# it was not a very nice picture
# right before the last bell rang she sneaked the drawing into Mister Slinger's book bag
# a bag yeah
# you've got a bag too and they're both purple
# oh
# wow that's great
# purple
# yes honey
# yes sweetie
# oh Lilly was very sad and ran all the way home
# she found a nice note from Mister Slinger and some snacks in her bag and she felt very guilty
# so her mother wrote a note and her father made some delicious snacks
# the next morning Lilly got_to school early
# these are for you she said to Mister Slinger because I'm really really really really really really really really really really really really sorry
# really really really really really really really sorry
# no she was just plain sorry
# Mister Slinger read the story and looked at the picture and sampled the snacks
# oh no

# some stars and some swirls too
# you know what honey Mommy's very tired because someone got up at four in the morning

# then she did a little performance using her bag and glasses and props
# it's called an interpretive dance said Lilly
# Mister Slinger joined in
# throughout the rest of the day
# yeah
# her purse and quarters were in her desk
# she looked at them often but did not disturb a soul
# she ran and skipped and hopped and flew all the way home
# she wanted to be a teacher

# sweetie do you wanna read a book
# do you want to read Paddington
# okay let Mommy go get Paddington I think he's in the kitchen
# you're going to find it
# oh here Mommy found it
# find it
# kay
# okay we'll sit down
# and we'll read Paddington
# do you know what this says
# what does that say
# this book belongs to Mommy
# that's right this book belongs to Mommy
# cause it was hers when she was little
# one day Mister and Missus Brown were standing in Paddington station
# they were waiting for their daughter Judy who was coming home from school
# Suddenly Mister Brown noticed something small and furry behind a pile of mail bags
# look over there he said to Missus Brown I'm sure I saw a bear
# a bear said Missus Brown in Paddington station
# don't be silly Henry there can't be
# but there was
# it had a funny kind of a hat and was sitting all by itself on an old suitcase near the lost property office
# oh as they drew near the bear stood up and politely raised its hat
# good afternoon it said in a small clear voice can I help you
# we were wondering if we could help you said Missus Brown wherever have you come from
# the bear looked round carefully before replying
# darkest Peru I stowed away and I lived on marmalade
# Missus bear spotted a label around the bear's neck it said please look after this bear thank you Aunt Lucy
# Missus Brown went off to look for Judy and Mister Brown took Paddington into the cafeteria for something to eat
# he left Paddington sitting at a corner table near the window
# he soon returned carrying two steaming cups of
# tea
# and a large plate piled high with sticky cakes
# after his long journey Paddington was so hungry and thirsty he didn't know which to do first eat or drink
# I think I'll try both at the same time if you don't mind Mister Brown he announced
# and without waiting for a reply he climbed on the table
# Mister Brown stared out of the window pretending that he had tea with a bear at Paddington station every day of his life
# when Missus Brown came into the cafeteria with Judy she threw up her hands in horror
# Henry she said what are you doing to that poor bear he's covered with cream and jam
# at the sound of Missus bear's voice Paddington jumped so much he stepped on a patch of strawberry jam and fell over backwards into his saucer of tea
# oh no
# I think we'd better go before anything else happens said Mister Brown and he quickly led the way out of the cafeteria
# Judy took Paddington's paw and squeezed it
# come along she said we'll take you home in a taxi
# then you can have a nice hot bath and meet my brother Jonathan
# Paddington had never been in a taxi before he found it very exciting
# and he stood on a little tip up seat behind the driver so he could wave to the people in the street
# soon they pulled up outside a large house with a green front door
# when they were indoors Judy took Paddington up to his room to unpack
# he has a picture of Aunt Lucy
# hm
# next she showed Paddington the bathroom
# as soon as he was on his own he turned on the taps and climbed onto the stool in order to look out of the window
# then he tried to write his name on the steamy glass with his paw
# it took him rather a long time and when he looked round he found to his surprise that the bath was so full of water it was starting to run over the side
# uhoh
# uhoh
# he closed his eyes and holding his nose with one paw he jumped in
# the water was hot and soapy and very deep and to his horror he couldn't get out
# he couldn't even turn the taps off
# Paddington tried calling out help at first in a quiet voice so as not to disturb anyone but then much louder help help
# but still nobody came
# then he had an idea
# he took off his hat and began using it to bail out the water
# downstairs Judy was telling her brother all about Paddington
# when suddenly she felt a plop
# looking up she saw a dark wet patch on the ceiling
# Paddington she cried he must be in trouble quick
# and they raced out of the room and up the stairs
# Jonathan and Judy leaned over the side of the bath and lifted a dripping and very frightened Paddington onto the floor
# what a mess said Jonathan we'd better wipe it up pretty quickly
# oh Paddington said Judy what good luck we found you in time you might have drowned
# Paddington sat up what good like I had
# some time later a beautifully clean Paddington came downstairs
# settling himself down in a small armchair by the fire he put his paws behind his head and stretched out his toes
# it was nice being a bear especially a bear called Paddington
# he had a feeling life with the Browns was going to be fun
# that's right Paddington's lying on the chair with the pillows he's relaxing
# ooh he's very comfortable
# shh he's going to sleep shh
# did you wanna go pick out another book honey

# his mother called him wild thing and Max said I'll eat you up
# so he was sent to bed without eating anything
# oh no
# that very night in Max's room a forest grew
# and grew
# and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and his walls became the world all around
# and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max and he sailed off through night and day
# what's he doing
# he's in a boat
# and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are
# wow
# and when he came to the place where the wild things are they roared their terrible roars and they gnashed their terrible teeth and they rolled their terrible eyes and they showed their terrible claws
# do you think they're scary
# do you think they're funny
# till Max said be still
# and tamed them with the magic trick of staring into their yellow eyes without blinking once
# and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all
# and made him king of all wild things
# that's a chicken wild thing
# yes
# bock bock bock bock bock
# do you see any other
# what other animals do you see
# oh yes
# which what animal does this one look like
# he does look like a cow
# you're right
# and now cried Max let the wild rumpus begin
# and they danced by the light of the moon
# and they hung from the trees
# and they had their wild thing parade
# now stop Max said and sent the wild things to bed without their supper
# and Max the king of all wild things was lonely
# and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all
# and all around from far away across the world he smelled good things to eat
# so he gave up being king of where the wild things are
# but the wild things cried oh please don't go we'll eat you up we love you so
# and Max said no
# the wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws
# but Max stepped into his private boat and waved goodbye
# byebye
# and sailed back over a year and in and out of weeks and through a day
# and into the night of his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him

# okay it's right next to Manuela
# can you say thank you
# Frederic
# all along the meadow where the cows grazed and the horses ran there was an old stone wall
# in that wall not far from the barn and the granary a chatty family of field mice had their home
# that's right nuts and wheat
# but the farmers had moved away the barn was abandoned and the granary stood empty
# and since winter was not far off the little mice began to gather corn and nuts and wheat and straw
# and they all worked day and night all except Frederick
# Frederick looks like he's asleep
# Frederick why don't you work they asked
# I do work they're carrying corn
# I gather sun rays for the cold dark winter days
# and when they saw Frederick sitting there staring at the they said
# nuts and wheat
# they said and now Frederick I gather colors answered Frederick simply for winter is gray
# that's right
# and once Frederick seemed half asleep are you dreaming Frederick they asked reproachfully but Frederick said oh no I'm gathering words for the winter days are long and many and we'll run out of things to say
# huh what's coming down
# snow
# the winter days came and when the first snow fell the five little field mice took to their hideout in the stones
# &-um they're eating cookies wow they're lucky
# in the beginning there was lots to eat and the mice told stories of foolish foxes and silly cats and they were a happy family
# they were very happy
# but little by little they had nibbled up most of the nuts and berries the straw was gone and the corn was only a memory
# it was cold in the wall and no one felt like chatting
# and then they remembered what Frederick had said about sun rays and colors and words what about your supplies Frederick
# close your eyes said Frederick as he climbed on a big stone I send you the rays of sun
# do you feel their golden glow and as Frederick spoke of the sun the four little mice began to feel warmer was it Frederick's voice
# was it magic
# and what about the colors Frederick close your eyes again he said and he told them of the blue periwinkles the red poppies and the yellow wheat and the green leaves of the berry bush
# and they saw the colors as clearly if they had been painted in their minds
# and the words Frederick
# Frederick cleared his throat waited a moment and then said as if from a stage aren't we lucky the seasons are four what if there was one less or one more
# why Frederick they said you're a poet Frederick blushed took a bow and said shyly I know it
# I know it
# another book
# you wanna get some from mommy's room I think she's got better books in her room
# no okay
# ah little miss spider

# &-um yeah

# acorn alley
# huh lil miss spider's home she lives in the tree
# should we read it
# little miss spider got ready for school she packed her new notebook her pencils and
# peering outside she sipped tea from her cup and eagerly watched for the sun to come
# up
# she dreamt as she gazed her mind running through the wonderful things she'd learn how to do
# huh wow look at all the things
# she's painting
# she's reading
# she's doing science experiments
# doing math she's adding her numbers she's swinging she's flying she's playing with a ball she's skipping rope and she's learning her alphabet too
# mhm
# sunny patch school was the best place to go to study lessons that all bugs ought_to know
# there were classes and climbing and clinging to walls for hiding in bushes and curling in balls
# she would learn about flowers from petal to root how to chew tasty leaves and tunnel through fruit
# yummy
# she gobbled her breakfast a fresh flower plate and ran the whole way to be first at the gate
# the principal smiled as he pulled back the latch I know you'll be happy at dear sunny patch
# but she found she lacked talent for hiding in trees for chirping like crickets or humming like bees
# she hadn't the strength to drill leaves with her tongue and hardly the stomach for digging in dung
# I am useless at stinging she said with a sigh perhaps I'll be better at learning to fly
# there's little miss spider
# she is sad
# each student was tossed from a leaf of a rose poor little miss spider fell flat on her
# nose
# the school day was over they sounded the bell she sobbed is there anything I can do well
# then she heard a bug cry I'm stuck in a spout and she climbed to the top and hoisted him out
# that's the bug I think he's an ant
# right
# the principal beamed as he watched from afar he lifted miss spider and gave her a
# a star
# our gifts they are many we hop fly and crawl but kindness he said is the finest of all
# huh sunny patch school
# honey hive
# froggy bog and taddy puddle

# Paddington's lucky day
# you know Paddington lives in England
# we went to England when we went to Ireland the airplane stopped there
# one day not long after Paddington went to live with the Browns at number thirty two Windsor Gardens Missus Brown thought she would take him out shopping
# we're going to Portabello Road exclaimed Judy
# it's a big outdoor market quite near here
# you should bring your pocket money added Jonathan
# there's a lot to see
# Paddington didn't need asking twice and soon afterward they all set off
# suddenly they turned a corner and found himself in what seemed like a different world
# a world of outdoor stands and push carts gold and silver ornaments books old furniture fruit and vegetables people
# his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in
# sweetie pie you know what
# you know the you know where your armoire is in your room
# you know where we keep your books in your room
# in your bedroom
# exactly the thing that your diapers are in
# there's a picture on there and Daddy and I bought that picture on Portabello road
# before you were born
# and a picture of a Mommy and her little baby girl
# yeah
# one store was even having its picture taken
# that's a new supermarket explained Judy
# there must be something special going on there
# do we like the supermarket
# what do you get at the supermarket
# that's right
# Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the through the glass
# perhaps I could do some shopping for you Missus Brown he said hopefully
# Missus Brown hesitated
# she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon
# but Jonathan told her not to worry
# even Paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said
# what goes in must come out
# we can meet him back by the check
# Paddington felt most important as he entered the store
# he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door
# that's the manager
# what's he wearing
# a suit right
# and that man's wearing a coat
# what's he wearing around his neck
# a tie you're right
# and what's that man wearing on his face
# what's he wearing on his
# over his eyes
# is he wearing
# that's right he's wearing glasses
# everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans
# there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade
# marmalade's like jam
# do you like jam
# there it is you're right
# he could certainly see why it was called a super market
# his paws were soon full and he was just beginning to wish he's left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming towards him pushing a large basket on wheels
# may I suggest you use one of these sir he called
# you can take as much as you want now he continued
# can I really exclaimed Paddington
# the manager nodded
# yes we like to make our customers happy
# Paddington looked most impressed
# in that case he said I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure
# the more Paddington saw of the super market the more he liked it
# and he was sure Missus Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries
# uhoh
# Paddington thinks he can take them for free
# the other customers looked on in amazement
# perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady as he went by
# but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddington with interest
# since he had been in the sore the manager had been joined by several other important looking men
# and as Paddington reached the check out counter one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap
# Paddington had never been in a store where they tried so hard to make their customers happy and he gave the man a friendly wave
# achoo did someone sneeze
# is your nose stuffy
# do you want Mommy to clean it
# your sneeze fell
# oh
# well done said the lady handing him a ticket
# I hope you've brought a truck with you
# there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here
# Paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw
# over a hundred and fifty dollars worth he gasped
# but I've only got a nickel
# looking up Paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him
# watch out cried the lady as he made a grab for the groceries
# but it was too late
# with a roar like an express train everything began to tumble down off the counter
# oh no it's falling on Paddington
# Paddington was still sitting on the floor covered in groceries
# where's Paddington
# there he is
# he was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the Browns rushed into the store to see what was going on
# all in all he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being
# what's that
# a turkey
# that's right
# you wouldn't think said the manager that giving someone a prize would be so difficult
# a prize echoed the Browns
# and the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall
# this young bear happens to be our thousandth customer today
# that's a big sign
# perhaps you'd like to tell him he's won a free supply of groceries
# all of which said Judy as they staggered home laden with groceries only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet
# even in super markets
# Paddington sniffed the air happily
# I like Portabello road he said
# I think I shall always do my shopping here from now on
# yay
# what book do you wanna read now
# which book is that
# Paddington at the seaside
# great
# he's got some floaties on
# he's got some floats on his arms
# today said Mister Brown at breakfast one bright summer morning feels like the kind of day for taking a young bear to the seaside
# hands up all those who agree
# Jonathan Judy and Missus Brown all put up their hands
# and Paddington raised both his paws as well just to make sure
# there's a tent at the seaside there is we're gonna get to that you're right
# everyone was very excited and by the time they set out the Brown's car was so full of things there was scarcely room to move
# Paddington carefully fastened his seat
# do you think he sits in a special car
# yes I think so too
# are we nearly there Mister Brown he asked hopefully
# he's looking out the window you're right
# Mister Brown removed a shovel handle from his left ear
# I'm afraid not he said gloomily we've only just left Windsor gardens and it's a very long way to the sea
# Mister Brown was right it was a long journey
# but when they reached the seaside the sight of the land and water soon made up for it
# Paddington gave an excited sniff as he climbed out of the car
# even the air had a different smell
# that's because it's special seaside air said Missus Brown it's very good for you
# what are those
# what are those
# remember what type of special bird they are near the ocean
# are they seagulls
# yeah
# you saw a sign with seagulls on Waterman street
# when we were driving back
# she I just taught her seagulls this morning and we were driving back from my sister's &-um when she was at work
# Lily said seagulls seagulls and there's like a
# I don't know some sort of
# like a dental office or something like that that's got seagulls on it
# are you so smart
# yeah
# Paddington looked around anxiously as Mister Brown began laying out beach things
# I hope the air doesn't get used up Missus Brown he said in a loud voice
# and he gave a man doing deep breathing exercises a very hard stare indeed
# come on Paddington called Judy let's go for a swim
# it took Paddington quite a while to get ready
# he wasn't the sort of bear who believed in taking chances and by the time he went into the sea he was wearing so many things he promptly sank
# no wonder cried Judy you haven't even bothered to blow up your paw bands
# fancy wearing a duffel coat in the water exclaimed Jonathan
# I thought the water might be cold said Paddington
# after his paw bands had been properly blown up Paddington went in the water again
# and with some help from Jonathan and Judy he was soon swimming very well indeed
# oh she's got a lollipop
# Paddington had barely closed his eyes when he had heard something very strange going on behind him
# first there was a loud cry
# then there were the sound of people booing
# they're watching Mister Briggs' Punch and Judy explained Missus Brown
# Paddington jumped up
# lollipop
# jumped up and looked at the others as if he could hardly believe his ears
# but Mister and Missus Brown seemed much too busy with the picnic things to be bothered
# oh who's got the ice cream cone
# where's Paddington asked Jonathan when he and Judy arrived back shortly afterwards carrying ice cream cones and an ice stick
# I hope he's not long said Judy I brought him a special cone
# he'll be most upset if it melts
# Jonathan glanced up and down the beach crikey he said look over there
# the Browns gave a gasp as they turned to follow the direction of Jonathan's gaze
# something very odd seemed to be going on inside the Punch and Judy tent
# there was a large bulge on one side and it was heaving up and down almost as if it were alive
# suddenly the tent began moving across the sand scattering people in all directions
# it just missed a large sand castle went twice around the ice cream man and headed toward sea
# quick shouted Judy let's cut it off
# but it was too late
# Paddington cried Judy as a familiar face swam into view
# what on earth are you doing
# that's the second time I've had to rescue you
# Paddington stared at her in amazement
# but I went to rescue you he said
# seagulls
# Missus Brown said you were being punched by Mister Briggs
# Missus Brown
# seagulls
# Missus Brown looked at Paddington in astonishment
# and then her face cleared
# I didn't say Mister Briggs was punching Judy I said it was his Punch and Judy
# it's a puppet theater said Judy
# they often have them at the seaside
# there's one puppet called Mister Punch and when he gets cross all the audience has to boo
# a lollipop
# if it took the Browns a long time to explain a Punch and Judy show to Paddington it took them even longer to explain Paddington to Mister Briggs
# but when he saw the enormous crowd watching his face lit up
# it was the biggest audience he'd had in a long time and decided to make the most of it by putting on another show
# you can have a seat in the front row he said to Paddington
# I expect bears do very good boos
# one way and another Paddington enjoyed his day out at the seaside
# but all good things come to an end and when it was time to leave he stood for a moment holding up an empty marmalade jar
# I'm just collecting some sea air for the journey home he said
# I think I shall sleep so well on the way back I may lose all of today's air with my snores
# yay
# I always like when you get British books the language is written so much nicer than
# right and he did very well indeed or
# things like that which like in some of
# and some of her books are great &-um
# and some of her rhyming books are really good because then she can finish the sentence once she hears it a few times
# like the rhyming helps her but
# you know some of them
# oh my gosh
# wow what books did you bring
# the cookie book
# and the Sam book wow
# you wanna read Sam
# which should we read first Sam or cookies
# Sam
# don't you feel well Sam
# it was a cold cold night on plum street
# in the little white house Missus Bear was putting Sam to bed
# she closed their favorite book and they both blew out the candle
# kiss good_night Sam Missus Bear said and she wrapped him all cozy in the blanket that was red
# but suddenly she heard a cough
# what does a cough sound like
# and there sat Sam curled up and small and coughing in his bed
# Missus Bear put her arms around Sam
# don't you feel well Sam
# Sam shook his head
# poor Saam
# Missus Brown hugged him harder and kissed his warm cheek
# you have a cough she said and she dashed down the stairs and up again with
# the cough syrup
# open wide Sam she said
# Sam shook his head
# tastes bad he said
# yes said his Mama you need to be brave
# Sam put the blanket on his head
# I don't have a cough
# try again Sam said his Mama
# Sam shook the blanket off his head
# he opened up then closed his mouth tight
# the spoon was too big
# too big said Sam
# you can do it Missus Bear said
# I know you can
# Sam opened up then closed his mouth tight
# too much syrup on a too big spoon
# too much said Sam
# Missus Bear rubbed frost off the window and peeked outside
# soon it will snow she said open wide Sam and afterward we'll go downstairs and wait for snow
# snow
# Sam opened wide then very wide
# he sputtered and snorted and made a big face but the syrup went down
# brave Sam he said
# brave Sam
# Missus Bear and Sam held hands on the stairs
# Sam wore his robe that was blue and his slippers were too
# they lit a little fire in the kitchen and made a pot of
# tea
# and Missus Bear put extra
# honey in the tea and it was nice sliding down
# after tea they sat in the big purple chair by the window and waited for snow
# Missus Bear told a story about a bear called Sam
# Sam liked the story so much she told it again
# went the cough every now and then
# Sam leaned back on his Mama's soft belly which wriggled when she talked
# the little fire glowed and the kitchen was warm
# and all through the night Missus Bear and Sam sat in the big purple chair and waited
# and finally it snowed
# but they were fast asleep
# the door that's their door you're right
# and what did they do the next day
# they played in the snow and they made a snow bear you're right
# what's that
# do you know what animal that is
# I think it's a fox cause it's orange
# 0a fox kind of looks like a wolf
# but I think it's a fox
# you wanna read your cookie book

# ah books
# what book is that
# Lulu
# Norman the doorman
# you wanna read Norman
# Norman
# okay
# okay
# in front of a small well hidden hole
# around and back of the majestic museum of art there once stood a mouse named
# Norman
# Norman was a doorman
# he greeted all the art loving creatures
# she's wearing a dress
# you're right
# you're right
# oh I think he's wearing a lil scarf
# on his neck
# he greeted all the art loving creatures
# who came to see the treasures
# which were kept in the basement of the museum
# come right in Norman would say
# a lil scarf
# and a dress
# right
# right a scarf
# we're quite safe said Norman I sprung all the traps
# oo what do you see
# a bust
# we saw a white bust in the museum here right
# Norman would explain every painting in detail
# and handle each masterpiece masterpiece with as much care
# a sad clown and a statue you're right
# he handled each masterpiece with as much care and respect as if he had painted it himself
# he would also take great pride in pointing out the artistic features of certain pieces of Greek sculpture
# which rested in the dark corners of the storage room
# she is wearing quite a snazzy dress I think
# as oh we missed a page
# Norman's only worry was keeping out of sight of the sharp eyed upstairs guard
# who often came to the basement to set traps for mice
# his bright flashlight frightened the visitors
# I know they're running away from the guard
# yeah
# as for Norman he always managed to escape
# and hide inside an old armored knights helmet
# up there he felt perfectly safe
# actually the helmet was Norman's home
# which he had made into a very comfortable and workable studio
# just see what a splendid sky light the visor made
# like most everybody Norman had a hobby
# each night after work he tried to create something pleasing or beautiful
# perhaps a painting of swiss cheese and crackers or a statue
# one bitter cold day Norman decided to stay in his studio and make something out of wire
# I know he's making something out of wire
# it's a mouse trap
# he took it apart
# and he's taking the wire off of it to make a sculpture right
# right
# he made a trapeze
# that's right
# all through the day and far into the night Norman twisted and bent wires into many strange and mysterious shapes
# until at last he created something he was really proud of
# it looked for all the world like a mouse on a trapeze
# oh yes
# that night when he finally went to sleep he was a tired but happy mouse
# early next morning when Norman went outside to shovel away snow in front of his doorway
# he noticed a man reading a sign nearby
# he read the sign to
# sculpture contest
# open to all artists great and small
# last day today
# back he flew
# why can't I show my wire statue he said
# as he slid through the visor opening
# but what would he call it
# all pieces must have a title he well knew
# suddenly he had an inspiration
# stripping off the printed word trap from the label and ripping off the letters eese from the word cheese he pasted them together
# trapeze
# now he had a fitting title for his wire work
# although Norman was a modest mouse he practically burst a button off his coat
# then as this was the last day for artists to bring their sculpture pieces
# Norman put a cover over his statue as he
# there the mouse is hiding there under the cover
# yeah away he scooted
# up the snowy staircase he climbed
# once inside the huge museum he eagerly followed the other sculptors from one room to another
# he still had to be extremely careful of the guard
# there's a bust you're right
# the other bust is sad
# yes
# the accordion right
# you're right
# what's this
# is that a statue of a woman dancing
# yeah
# she looks like she's having a good time
# don't you think
# yes
# and there's a statue of a man riding a horse
# and a statue of a lil boy and girl holding a balloon
# after carefully removing the cover from his wire statue he left it on the floor with the rest of the contestants work
# out he went into the snowy afternoon knowing he had done his best
# you see he had not forgotten he was a doorman who had a job to do
# she is wearing a dress
# what color is her dress
# oh another dress
# wow
# two dresses what color are they
# yellow and pink
# meanwhile upstairs in the sculpture gallery of the museum
# the judges were busy judging
# oh
# there it is
# quietly and seriously they examined each piece
# trying to find which ones deserved prizes
# gradually they found themselves huddled around a certain statue
# now this is an amazing creation exclaimed one
# there's no name and isn't it a shame it's so tiny
# yes but remember the contest is open to great and small
# one by one each guard when asked if he had knew who had brought it in shook his head and said no not I
# the museum director couldn't understand why none of them had caught sight of the artist
# but when the sharp eyed guard took a closer look he gasped
# so this is where my mouse traps have been going
# I think I know where to start looking for that tricky trap snatcher
# and without waiting another minute the guard snapped on his flash light and hurried downstairs to the basement
# what's this one of my traps stuck in a knights helmet
# he lifted up the visor to investigate
# there inside he saw pieces of wire and parts of traps
# and strangest of all a neat straw bed which could only belong to a mouse
# whoever he is he must be very find of my cheese said the guard
# during all this time Norman had been tending to his duty as a doorman
# a party of mice from the country for whom he had be waiting
# was long passed due
# and he was getting mighty cold and hungry
# but to his surprise who should come around the corner but the sharp eyed guard
# there you are said the guard as Norman fled inside
# but when the guard held a piece of cheese above the hole Norman sniffed it
# he couldn't help poking his nose out to get a better whiff
# and just as he was about to reach up and snatch the cheese a hand came around swiftly and caught Norman by the tail
# are you the rascal who's been taking my mouse traps everyday and using them for artistic purposes asked the guard
# it's just my hobby said Norman
# it's just my hobby
# oh there having a big party
# the guard tossed Norman up on his shoulder
# Norman was sure he was being taken to jail
# you can imagine his surprise when instead they entered the museum and heard the artist all clapping and cheering hooray for trapeze
# hooray for trapeze
# why I'll be bamboozled cried the guard
# I do believe you've won a prize
# the guard rushed right up to the judges platform and said proudly
# here's the winner I found him freezing in the snow
# indeed said the head judge
# why yes who else would could have created the daring mouse on the trapeze
# what is your name my good fellow
# and what would you like for your prize
# if you please sir my name is Norman
# and I'm the doorman downstairs
# and I've always dreamed of seeing the upstairs of the museum without getting caught
# that's what I'd like best
# there's a bust
# and another bust
# and that's
# yes
# the guard led Norman out into the hall
# where together they began a grand tour of the entire art museum
# later that night when Norman returned from returned to his door
# he found his mice friends from the country waiting for him
# of course Norman invited them in where he shared with them an enormous slice of cheese
# a present given to him from the warm hearted guard
# what a wonderful way to end the day
# good night
# yay

# so did I tell you Manuela
# that there you know they come up with all this information now about tuna
# that women of child bearing age shouldn't eat more than a certain amount of tuna because it has mercury in it
# and so pregnant women or people planning to get pregnant shouldn't eat that much tuna and young children and whatever
# so she loves it
# so &-um although not with mayonnaise
# only eats tuna in olive oil
# like she eats italian tuna in olive oil and salt
# I know
# oh she wearing a dress too
# so I called I kept meaning to ask the pediatrician and I forgot to ask her when we were there for our two year appointment
# so I called one day and it's a big practice
# and you know a bunch of doctors running around
# told her I was a patient of Dr Louis I was wondering if you could ask
# yes sweetie pie
# okay sweetie mommy has Hondo and Fabian to if you wanna read it
# oh
# you wanna read that one
# okay
# oh I'm sorry angel
# I'm sorry
# did I just scratch your lil nose
# can I kiss it
# does that feel better
# oh good
# so I call up and I said can you ask if there's does the practice have any guide
# cause she wants everyday for lunch can we have tuna
# so I've only been I've been trying to give it to her once a week
# and she'll eat like a three ounce can
# but even that I'm like it's so hard to wait a whole week to give it to her cause she wants it
# and &-um so I called and the woman's like okay I'll ask like you're crazy
# she gets back on the phone she goes Dr Lang said one to two ounces a week
# so the woman goes my son eats tuna everyday
# so this is what they're recommending for
# so they said a grown woman can have a can of tuna a week and young kids are suppose to have one to two
# I know
# I eat it too
# I know
# I mean I think it's only related to pregnancy
# and young kids but I guess the mercury will affect brain development
# potentially
# you know they said canned tuna has less than fresh tuna it's really I guess it's tuna and swordfish that your suppose to cut back on
# but one to two if they're really suggesting one to two ounces a week I can't believe that they don't hand this out on a flyer to people
# she would literally eat it everyday if she could
# I know literally the small the tiny can with the flip
# top that you'll buy for lunch that comes with crackers or whatever
# that's three ounces and it's like this big tiny
# right or anyone who can potentially become pregnant
# right
# what would you like sweetie
# you can climb under and get it
# I don't know what she's looking for actually
# you can scoot over and get that honey
# can you say thank you Manuela

# their dancing by the light of the moon

# and rolled their terrible eyes

# now Benny has no money to buy Buster a new ball
# which you will remember Pete ate many letters ago
# once in a while we go to the woods
# and Pete is perfect
# then I'm at the opinion that this dog is okay
# oops we're up to p
# he ate Mrs Parsley's pink pocket book
# and she said take that Pete back to the pet shop
# and get yourself a polite pooch
# those are the twinkle twins
# mhm
# poo on Mrs Parsley
# quick question
# would you love a dog who ate your lucky quarter
# a q from your alphabet collection
# and your porcupine quill
# even if for the quadrillionth time you said quit it
# don't eat that and he did
# would you still love that dog
# quite a lot
# one rainy day he ate a rubber glove
# and the rubber band necklace that Mrs Parsley wore to a meeting of the rubber band society
# Roberta Rothchild is the president of the rubber band society
# now Pete bounces around the room
# he ate Mooky's stinky sneaker for breakfast
# Doreen Parsley's sandal for lunch
# Rocky's pointy shoe from Japan for dinner
# and a soft suede slipper for a midnight snack
# the twinkle twins have a dog named Twinkie
# Twinkie may look insane
# but she does not eat their things
# Twinkie looks like she's got like sticks coming out of her fur
# should we show should we show Manuela a picture of Twinkie and the Twinkle twins
# they're wearing pink dresses right
# you can understand I would be unhappy to say this but
# Pete ate cousin Rocky's
# underpants
# ugh
# while Mooky was playing the violin
# very badly thank you very much
# Pete ran off with the veal roast
# very angry hungry family
# those are the twinkle twins again
# what can I say
# there's Poppy Wise
# in his wallet Rocky keeps a list of all the times he was insulted in his whole life
# it use to look like this
# right and now it looks like this
# wow
# when Pete eats extra crunchy extra cheesy cheese doodles
# he turns bright
# orange
# yikes
# he ate Mooky's yoyo
# my yoyo
# right they were wearing pink dresses
# now they're wearing blue dresses
# my yoyo
# Doreen's yoyo
# and the yoyos of the twinkle twins and now there will be no yoyo contest

# all along the meadow
# where the cows grazed and the horses ran
# was an old stone wall
# in that wall not far from the barn
# in the greenery
# he's half asleep
# you're right
# a chatty family of field mice had their home
# their home
# but the farmer's had moved away
# the barn was abandoned
# and the greenery stood empty
# he's half asleep Fredrick
# and since winter was not far off
# the lil mice began to gather corn
# and nuts and wheat and straw
# and they all worked day and night
# all except
# Fredrick right
# Fredrick why don't you work they asked
# I do work said Fredrick

# do you feel their golden glow
# and then he told them of the blue periwinkles
# and the red poppies
# and the yellow wheat
# and the green leaves on the berry bush
# they saw the colors as clearly as they saw as if they had been painted in their minds
# and the words Fredrick
# Fredrick cleared his throat
# waited a moment
# and then as if from a stage
# said wanna hear Fredrick's poem
# who scatters the snowflakes
# who melts the ice
# who spoils the weather
# who makes it nice
# who grows the four leaf clover in June
# who dims the day light
# who lights the moon
# four lil field mice who live in the sky
# four lil field mice like you and I
# one is the spring mouse who turns on the showers
# then comes in the summer who paints in the flowers
# the fall mouse is next with walnuts and wheat
# and winter is last with lil cold feet
# aren't we lucky the seasons are four
# think of a year with one less or one more
# when Fredrick had finished they all applauded
# but Fredrick they said you are a poet
# Fredrick blushed
# and took a bow
# and said I know it
# I know that's how we made Fredrick

# I know you're not small
# but I'm sure you can do it no trouble at all
# just sit on it softly
# you're gentle and kind
# sweet stuff I'm not done with that page
# do you want to finish the page
# I can't said the elephant
# please begged the bird
# I won't be gone long I give you my word
# I'll hurry right back I'll never be missed
# very well said the elephant
# since you insist
# you want a vacation
# go fly off and take it
# I'll sit on your egg and try not to break it
# hm the first thing to do murmured Horton let's see
# first thing to do is to prop up this tree
# and make it much stronger that has to be done
# before I get on I must weigh a
# a ton
# then Horton the elephant smiled
# now that's that
# and he sat and he sat and he sat and he sat
# and sat all that day and kept the egg warm
# it's raining
# it's raining very hard isn't it
# through a terrible storm
# and it poured and it lightning
# it thundered and rumbled
# this isn't much fun the elephant grumbled
# but Mazy by that time was far beyond reach
# enjoying the sunshine way off in Palm Beach
# and having such fun such a wonderful rest
# decided she'd never go back to her nest
# oh no
# there's snow all over Horton
# so Horton kept sitting there day after day
# and soon it was autumn the leaves blew away
# and then came the winter
# the snow and the sleet
# and the icicles hung from his trunk and his feet
# so poor Horton sat there the whole winter through
# he's all clean now
# and then came spring time with troubles anew
# his friends gathered round and shouted with glee
# look Horton the elephant is up in a tree
# they taunted and teased him and said how absurd
# old Horton the elephant thinks he's a bird
# no matter what happens this egg must be tended
# but poor Horton
# right
# they are wearing suits
# black eyes right
# three hunters came up softly from behind
# he heard the men's footsteps and turned with a start
# three rifles were aiming right straight at his heart
# did he run
# he did not
# Horton stayed on that nest
# held his head high
# and threw out his chest
# and he looked at the hunters as much as to say
# shoot if you must but I won't run away
# but the men didn't shoot much to his surprise
# they dropped their three guns and stared with wide eyes
# hm
# and the first thing he knew they had built a big wagon
# yeah that's one of the hunters
# with ropes on front for the pullers to drag on
# and dug up his tree and put it inside
# with Horton so sad he practically cried
# up out of the jungle up into the sky
# up over the mountains
# is that a baby elephant
# oh
# then down down the mountains and down into the sea went the cart and the elephant
# with nest and tree
# that's one of the hunters
# he's pushing that cart
# there's a fish
# he's swimming you're right
# he's swimming in the water you're right
# Horton Horton is on a ship
# right
# right
# red boat or a yellow boat
# right
# out of the wagon and onto a ship
# over the ocean and oh what a trip
# rolling and tossing and splash with the spray
# and Horton said day after day after day
# I meant what I said and I said what I meant
# but oh am I sea sick
# one hundred percent
# after bobbing around two week on the port
# they landed at last in the town of
# New York
# all a shore the men shouted and down with a lurch
# and Horton the elephant still on his perch
# tied on to a board that could just scarcely hold him
# bump
# my daddy works in Boston
# he's selling tickets
# he's selling tickets
# those are red tickets
# you buy a ticket and then your allowed to go into the show
# then one day the circus show happened to reach a town way down south not far from Palm Beach
# and dawdling along way up high in the sky
# who of all people should chance to fly by
# but that old good for nothing bird run away Mazy
# still on vacation and still just as lazy
# and she swooped from the clouds through an open tent door
# good gracious gasped Mazy I've seen you before
# poor Horton looked up with his face white as chalk
# he started to speak but before he could talk
# they rang out the noisiest ear splitting squeaks from the egg he had sat on for fifty one weeks
# a thumping a bumping a wild alive scratching
# my egg shouted Horton my egg
# it's hatching
# but it's mine screamed the bird
# a baby is gonna come out of the egg
# it's mice she sputtered you stole it from me
# get off of my nest and out of my tree
# poor Horton backed down with a sad heavy heart
# there's the baby
# but at that very instant the egg burst apart
# the baby came out of the egg
# and out of the pieces of red and white shell from the egg
# there's the baby
# it had ears and a tail and a trunk just like his
# and the people came shouting what's all this about
# and they looked and they stared ooh he's staring with his eyes popping out
# oh that Mazy bird is mad
# oh
# it should be it should be it should be like that
# because Horton was faithful he sat and he sat
# he meant what he said
# and said what I meant
# and they sent him home happy
# one hundred percent
# yay

# one day Mister and Misses Brown were standing in Paddington station
# they were waiting for their daughter Judy who was coming home from school
# suddenly Mr Brown noticed something small and furry behind a pile of mail bags
# look over there he said to Mrs Brown
# I'm sure I saw a
# a bear
# a bear said Mrs Brown
# in Paddington station
# don't be silly Henry there can't be
# this is Stephanie Stephanie this is by the way
# hi
# nice to meet you
# but there it was it had a funny kind of hat and was sitting all by itself in an old suitcase near the lost property office
# as they drew near the bear stood up and politely drew raised it's hat
# good afternoon it said in a small clear voice
# can I help you
# we were wondering if we could help you said Mrs Brown
# where ever have you come from
# the bear looked around carefully before replying
# darkest Peru
# I stowed away and lived on Marmalade
# Mrs Brown spired a label around the bear's neck
# it said simply please look after this bear
# thank you
# aunt Lucy
# Henry she exclaimed we shall have_to take him home with us
# but we don't even know his name began Mr Brown
# we'll call him
# Paddington said Mrs Brown
# because that's where we
# found him
# Mrs Brown went off to look Judy and Mr Brown took Paddington into the cafeteria for something to eat
# he left Paddington sitting at a table in the corner near the window
# and he soon returned carrying two steaming cups of tea and a large plate piled high with
# sticky cakes
# after his long journey Paddington felt so hungry and thirsty he didn't know which to do first eat or drink
# I think I'll try both at the same time if you don't mind Mr Brown he announced
# and without waiting for a reply he climbed up on to the table
# Mr Brown steered out of the window pretending he had tea with a bear at Paddington station everyday of his life
# what's Paddington doing
# oh_my_goodness
# he's standing on the table
# yikes
# when Mrs Brown came into the cafeteria with Judy she threw her hands up with horror
# Henry she said what are you doing to that poor bear
# he's covered all over with cream and jam
# oh is that the mommy
# that's Mrs Brown the mommy
# and there's the daddy
# and
# that's Judy right
# right
# at the sound of Mrs Brown's voice Paddington jumped so much he stepped on a patch of strawberry jam and fell over backwards into his saucer of tea
# I think we better go before anything else happens said Mr Brown
# and quickly led the way out of the cafeteria
# Judy took Paddington's paw and squeezed it
# what's on Paddington's foot
# is that a cup
# oh_my_goodness
# that is so messy
# come along she said we'll take you home in a taxi
# and you both can have a nice hot bath
# Paddington had never been in a taxi before
# do you remember what color the taxis are in New York
# in New York are they yellow
# yes
# he found it very exciting and stood on a lil tip up seat behind the driver so he could wave to the people on the street
# oh that's okay sweetie
# you want that
# soon they pulled up outside a large house with a green front door
# when they were indoors Judy took Paddington up to his room to unpack
# I haven't gotten very much said Paddington only some marmalade
# and my scrapbook
# and this sort of South American penny
# he held up a photograph and that's my aunt Lucy
# she had it taken right before she went into the home for retired bears
# what does that look like
# it looks like a dime
# I think it's a sort of penny
# it's a type of penny
# next Judy showed Paddington to the bathroom
# as soon as he was on his own he turned on the taps and climbed onto a stool to look out the window
# then he tried writing his name on the steamy glass with his paw
# it took him rather a long time
# and when he looked around he found his surprise the bath was so full of water it started to run over the side
# oh no
# he closed his eyes and holding his nose with one paw
# he jumped in
# the water was hot soapy and very deep
# then to his horror he found he couldn't get out
# he couldn't even see to turn the taps off
# oh no
# Paddington tried calling out help at first in a quiet voice so it's not to disturb anyone and then much louder
# help help
# but still nobody came
# then he had an idea
# he took off his hat and began to use it to bail out the water
# downstairs Judy was telling her brother all about Paddington
# when suddenly she felt a plop
# looking up she saw a dark wet patch on the ceiling
# Paddington she called he must be in trouble
# quick
# and together they raced out of the room
# Jonathan and Judy leaned over the side of the bath and lifted a dripping and very frightened Paddington onto the floor
# what a mess said Jonathan
# we better wipe it up pretty quickly
# oh Paddington said Judy what good luck we found you
# look at all that water on Paddington
# they took him out of the bath tub
# he's so wet isn't he
# yes
# Paddington sat up and said what good luck I had my hat
# sometime later a beautifully clean Paddington came downstairs
# settling himself down in a small arm chair by the fire
# he put his paws behind his head and stretched out his toes
# it was nice being a bear
# especially a bear called Paddington
# he had a feeling that life with the Brown's was going to be
# fun
# oh boy
# okay
# does your eye feel better honey
# a lil bit better

# oh Paddington's garden
# Paddington's garden
# one day Paddington decided to make a list of all the nice things there were about being a bear and living with the Brown's at number thirty two Winsor Gardens
# it was a long list and he had almost reached the end of the paper when he suddenly realized he left out one of the nicest things of all
# the garden itself
# wow that's nice
# Paddington liked the Brown's garden
# it was quiet and peacefully and there were times when it might not have been in London at all
# but nice gardens usually mean a lot of hard work
# and after a day at his office Mr Brown often wished it wasn't quite so large
# what's that
# there's Mrs Brown she's the mommy
# and the daddy too
# it was Mrs Brown who first thought of giving Jonathan Judy and Paddington a piece each of their own
# it will keep them out of mischief she said
# and will help you at the same time
# so Mr Brown marked up three squares and to make it more exciting he said he would give a price to whom ever had the best idea
# early next morning all three set to work
# Judy thought she would grow some flowers and Jonathan started to make a paved garden
# but Paddington didn't know what to do
# gardening was much harder than it looked
# especially with paws and he soon grew tired of digging
# in the end he decided to do some shopping
# he had some savings
# oh look he's buying what's he buying
# seeds
# and he has a basket
# and the trowel
# and he's gonna buy a lil wheel barrel to
# it seemed very good value indeed
# especially since he had two pence left over
# the shop keeper told him that when planning a new garden it was a good idea to stand some way away first in order to picture what it would look like when it was finished
# so taking a jar of his best chunky marmalade
# Paddington set out to visit the near by building site
# by the time he got there it was the middle of the morning
# and as the men were all at their tea break he sat down on a pile of bricks
# and put down his jar of marmalade
# hm
# after sitting there for some while without getting a single idea pit
# Paddington decided to take a short walk instead
# when he got back his eyes nearly popped out
# a man was emptying the concrete mixer on the very spot where he had left his jar of marmalade
# oh my
# at that moment the foreman came round and seen the look on Paddington's face
# he stopped to ask what was wrong
# oh my chunks have been buried he exclaimed hotly
# so they all set to work clearing the cement
# but there was no sign of Paddington's jar
# suddenly there was a worrying sound from over head
# a platform landed at his feet
# my marmalade he said
# I put it there ready for my tea break and it must have been taken out by mistake
# it was the foreman's turn to look as if he could hardly believe his eyes
# that's quick drying cement
# it's probably rock hard
# and no one will give me two pence for it now
# I will said Paddington
# and he took the lumps of concrete home
# and made a beautiful rockery
# when the builders saw
# there's his wheelbarrow
# and his concrete and his trowel
# concrete
# wheelbarrow
# trowel
# trowel
# and his seeds started to grow
# it fit so well with Jonathan's paved garden and Judy's flower bed it that it looked as if the whole thing had been planned
# and they celebrated by having tea in the new garden
# after it was over Paddington stayed on for a while in order to finish his list of all the nice things there were
# about being a bear and living at thirty two Winsor Gardens
# he had one more important item to add
# my rockery
# and signed his name and added his special paw print just to show that it was
# genuine
# very good
# yay
# genuine
# okay
# Lily would you like to go to a special children's museum today

# dandelion
# on a sunny Saturday morning dandelion
# that's his daddy
# you're right
# Dandelion woke up stretched and yawned and jumped out of bed
# after doing his daily exercises
# Dandelion looked out of the window
# blinked his eyes and said I wonder if the mail has come
# he put on his sweater and went outside to the mail box
# there was a letter and it was written in fancy gold ink
# dear Dandelion you are invited to my tea and taffy party on Saturday afternoon at half passed three
# come as you are
# sincerely Jennifer Giraffe
# Dandelion was very excited
# it's a good thing I'm getting a hair cut today he said
# as soon as he washed and dried the dishes
# and made his bed nice and neat
# he ran down the street to the barber shop
# Lou Kangaroo had a chair waiting for him
# first he trimmed Dandelion's hair
# and then gave him a shampoo
# Dandelion thought he should have a manicure to
# right he's cleaning his nails
# when Lou Kangaroo had finished Dandelion looked a bit foolish
# his mane was frizzy and fuzzy and completely unrulish
# silly
# maybe a wave would help Lou suggested showing him a picture in the latest fashion magazine for lions
# Dandelion agreed
# this was exactly what he needed
# so Lou went about curling his mane
# he looked
# magnificent
# but now
# magnificent
# but now Dandelion thought he'd
# magnificent
# magnificent
# very good honey
# but now Dandelion thought he really should wear something more elegant than a sweater to the party
# this jacket is the very newest style said Theodore the tailor
# and it just fits you
# all you need now is a cap and a cane
# Happy Crane will be happy to help you
# what a damper dandy he had suddenly become
# that's Happy Crane
# it's nearly half past three said Dandelion
# I've just time to get something for my hostess
# a bouquet of dandelions would be perfect
# he knew this tall door very well
# having been here many times before
# he rang the bell
# when Jennifer Giraffe opened the door she looked very surprised
# yes she said
# what can I do for you
# but I'm here for your party he said
# why I'm sorry sir you are not anyone I know she said
# you must have the wrong address
# and with that she closed the door right in poor Dandelion's face
# I'm Dandelion he roared you've made a mining mistake
# but the door stayed tight shut
# Dandelion walked back and forth down the block
# and as he paced
# he is sad
# the sky grew dark
# and a sudden gust of wind sprang up and blew away his beautiful bouquet
# and his snappy cap flew off
# they blew away in the wind
# oh no
# to make matters worse it began to rain in
# Torrance
# Dandelion dropped his cane
# and stood under a weeping willow tree
# but the rain pored down through the branches
# Dandelion was soon soak and wet and his curls came unfurled
# he took off his jacket
# and hung it on a willow branch
# luckily he had kept on his sweater
# at last the rain stopped
# and the warm sunshine came down
# Dandelion sat on Jennifer Giraffe's front steps until his mane was dry
# huh while he sat there waiting he spotted three dandelion flowers
# more dandelions
# they had been protected

# at last
# for finding your mother there's one certain test
# you must look for the creature who loves you the
# very good
# the best
# the best
# you wanna get another book
# okay
# okay
# huh
# what book is this
# Horton hatches the egg
# wow
# side lazy aside Mazy a lazy bird hatching an egg
# I'm tired and I'm bored and I have kinks in my leg
# from sitting just sitting here day after day
# it's work how I hate it I'd much rather play
# I'd take a vacation fly off for a rest
# if I could find someone to stay on my nest
# if I could find someone I'd fly away free
# do you wanna read Chester's way instead
# okay
# Chester's way
# Chester had his own way of doing things
# he always cut his sandwiches diagonally
# he always got out of bed on the same side
# and he never left the house without double knotting his shoes
# Chester always had the same thing for breakfast
# toast with jam and peanut butter
# and he always carried a miniature first aid kit in his back pocket
# just in case
# you definitely have a mind of your own said Chester's mother
# that's one way to put it said Chester's father
# Chester's best friend Wilson was exactly the same way
# that's why they were best friends
# Chester wouldn't play baseball unless Wilson played and they never swung at the first pitch or slid head first
# Wilson wouldn't ride his bicycle unless Chester wanted to and they always used hand signals
# if Chester was hungry Wilson was to
# but they rarely ate between meals
# some days I can't tell those two apart said Wilson's mother
# me either said Wilson's father
# Chester and Wilson Wilson and Chester
# that's the way it was
# they loved to go on picnics
# once when Wilson accidentally swallowed a watermelon seed and cried because he was afraid a watermelon plant would grow inside him
# Chester swallowed one to
# don't worry said Chester if you grow a watermelon plant I'll grow one to
# Chester duplicated his Christmas list every year and gave a copy to Wilson because they always wanted to same things anyway
# for Halloween they would always dress as things that went together
# salt and pepper shakers two mittens on a string
# ham and eggs
# they really are two peas in a pod said Chester's mother
# looks like it Chester's father
# in spring Chester and Wilson shared the same umbrella
# in winter they never threw snowballs at each other
# in fall they raked leaves together
# and in summer they reminded each other to wear sun screen to they wouldn't burn
# Chester and Wilson Wilson and Chester
# that's the way it was
# and then Lily moved into the neighborhood
# Lily had her own way of doing things
# let's not hurt your teeth okay honey
# she wore bandaids all over her arms and legs to look brave
# she talked backwards to herself sometimes so no one would know what she was saying
# and she never left the house without one of her nifty disguises
# Lily waved at all the cars that passed by even if she didn't know who was in them
# and she always carried a loaded squirt gun in her back pocket just in case
# she definitely has a mind of her own said Chester
# that's one way to put it said Wilson
# when Lily asked Chester and Wilson to play they said they were busy
# when she called them at home they disguised their voices and said they weren't home
# if Lily was walking on one side of the street Chester and Wilson crossed to the other side and hid
# she's something else said Chester
# looks like it said Wilson
# one day when Chester and Wilson were practicing their hand signals
# some older boys rode by
# well those are some older boys who rode by and they circled
# well that's an older boy and he's not very nice
# that's Wilson and Chester
# and that's an older boy
# and that's an older boy
# Chester and Wilson didn't know what to do
# right
# Chester and Wilson didn't know what to do
# just when they were about to give up hope a fierce looking cat with horrible fangs jumped out of the bushes and frightened the older boys away
# are you who I think you are Chester asked the cat
# of course the cat replied
# thank you Lily said Chester
# thank you cat
# you're welcome Chester said Lily
# thank you Lily said Wilson
# right
# she was
# you're welcome Wilson said Lily
# I'm glad you were wearing a disguise said Chester
# and I'm glad you had your squirt gun said Wilson
# I always do said Lily
# just in case
# afterward Chester invited Lily over for lunch
# you have a muscle mouse cup said Lily
# of course said Chester
# I do too
# right there see he's holding his cup
# oh her her cup must be at her house
# Chester and Wilson cut their sandwiches diagonally
# Lily asked Chester's mother if she had cookie cutters and she made stars and flowers and bells
# mhm
# and a flower right
# is that a flower shape sort of
# right
# right
# mhm
# right
# that night Lily invited Chester and Wilson to sleep over
# you have a night light said Chester
# of course said Lily
# right there
# wow
# Chester and Wilson wanted toast with jam and peanut butter for breakfast the next morning
# boring said Lily
# try this instead
# wow this is good said Chester
# wow said Wilson
# after that when Lily asked Chester and Wilson to play they said yes
# right
# that's right
# sometimes I can't tell these three apart said Lily's mother
# me either said Lily's father
# Chester and Wilson and Lily Lily and Wilson and Chester
# that's the way it was
# right right
# drums
# you're right
# you're right
# Chester has a purple balloon
# Wilson has a pink balloon and a drum
# Lily has a broom
# you're absolutely right
# for Halloween they dressed as the three blind mice
# for Christmas Lily gave Chester and Wilson nifty disguises
# well I think this is Chester because he's brown
# this is Lily because she's white
# and this is Wilson because he's grey
# right right Chester right Chester is wearing one of Lily's boots
# and Wilson is wearing the other one of Lily's boots
# you have a drippy lollie
# right a big picture
# in spring Chester Wilson and Lily shared the same umbrella
# in winter they never threw snowballs at each other
# in fall they raked leaves together
# and in summer they reminded each other to wear sun screen so they wouldn't burn
# Chester and Wilson and Lily
# Lily and Wilson and Chester
# that's the way it was

# should we read Cinderella first
# okay
# every day Cinderella woke up early to do chores for her stepmother and stepsisters
# from morning till night they gave her things to do
# but the birds and mice were Cinderella's friends and they helped her with her work
# one morning a messenger came from the palace to invite Cinderella and her stepsister to a royal ball
# Cinderella was very excited but her stepmother gave her a long list of chores to do before she could go
# what is she doing
# who's that
# you have a huge strawberry in your mouth
# while Cinderella was busy working the birds and mice began fixing an old dress that had belonged to Cinderella's mother
# before long they made Cinderella a beautiful gown
# by the time Cinderella finished her chores she thought it was too late to get ready for the ball and she was very sad
# surprise said the birds and mice and gave Cinderella the finished gown
# oh thank you so much she cried
# Cinderella got dressed and rushed to join her stepsisters but when they saw her they became jealous and tore her lovely gown to pieces
# oh
# Cinderella ran to the garden and wept just then sparkling lights swirled all around her it was her fairy godmother
# dry those tears she said you can't go to the ball looking like that
# with a wave of her magic wand the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a
# huh wha'd she turn the pumpkin into
# a coach and yyy Cinderella's rags into a gorgeous gown
# and with one more wave Cinderella had tiny
# glass slippers on her feet
# before she left the ball she received a warning though on the stroke of midnight the spell will be broken the fairy godmother told her and everything will be as before
# that night at the ball the prince met Cinderella without knowing each other's names they danced until the clock struck midnight
# I must go she cried but as she fled she lost a glass slipper on the staircase
# the next day the prince announced he wanted to marry the girl who had lost her glass slipper
# when the wicked stepmother realized it was Cinderella who was the prince's favorite she locked Cinderella in her room
# let me out Cinderella cried the grand duke went to every home in the kingdom looking for the maiden who's foot fit the tiny glass shoe
# Cinderella's little friends took the key out of the stepmother's pocket and slipped it under the door to Cinderella
# when the grand duke put the slipper on Cinderella's foot it fit perfectly
# soon after Cinderella and the prince were married and they lived happily ever after
# okay
# long ago there lived a lovely princess named Snow White
# her stepmother the queen was jealous of Snow White's beauty
# each day the queen would ask magic mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all
# and the mirror would always answer you are
# one day the mirror said a lovely maid I see who is more fair than thee
# the queen knew it must be Snow White
# Snow White was so beautiful and kind that even a handsome prince who was passing by noticed her
# little did he know that when he came into the courtyard to sing to Snow White the queen was watching
# the queen was so jealous
# Snow White realized she must leave home or risk being hurt by the queen she was so frightened that she ran deep into the forest
# do you know where I can stay she asked a group of friendly animals
# ooh what animals do you see
# there's a turtle wow
# and what else
# those are little deers right
# and what else
# bunny rabbits
# and
# birds
# djou know what this is with his little black mask
# that is a raccoon very good
# that's a raccoon and these little guys are chipmunks
# chipmunks
# and squirrels you're right
# the animals led Snow White to a tiny cottage in the woods
# it's like a doll's house she said
# she knocked on the door but no one answered
# so she slowly stepped inside
# Snow White found seven tiny bowls seven tiny chairs and seven tiny beds
# but the cottage was a mess oh my there must be seven tiny children living here
# let's clean the house and surprise them she said to her animal companions then maybe they'll let me stay
# that is a reindeer with his little antlers
# soon seven tiny men arrived the seven dwarfs
# Snow White promised to wash and sow and sweep for the little men and in return they kept her safe and happy
# the seven dwarfs loved having Snow White stay in their cottage
# back at the castle the magic mirror told the queen where Snow White was hiding
# the queen was so angry that she drank a potion that turned her into an old hag and she created a magic apple
# with one bite of this poisoned apple Snow White's eyes will close forever she said the only cure for the sleeping spell was love's first kiss
# as soon as the dwarfs went to work the queen disguised as a peddler woman approached Snow White the forest animals recognized the queen and ran off to warn the dwarfs
# oh no what's Snow White doing
# right she's eating the apple
# and she fell to the floor in a deep sleep
# the evil queen fled from the cottage but the seven dwarfs raced after her
# they chased her to a rocky cliff and when a rock broke beneath her feet the queen fell from the mountaintop into the darkness below
# the broken hearted dwarfs watched over Snow White day and night one day the prince appeared as he had been searching for the beautiful princess
# he kissed Snow White and she awakened
# Snow White kissed the dwarfs on their forehead and thanked them for all they had done
# raccoon
# hello

# Sleeping Beauty
# wow should we read this
# okay
# once upon a kind king and gentle queen had a baby girl named Aurora
# visitors came to see the baby including king Hubert who ruled a nearby kingdom and his young son prince Philip
# the two kings decided that Philip and Aurora would marry one day and unite the kingdoms
# the king and queen were so happy they held a celebration
# soon three good fairies Flaura Fauna and Merryweather arrived
# they came to give magical gifts to the baby princess
# Flaura said my gift shall be the gift of beauty and Fauna said my gift shall be the gift of song
# but before Merryweather could give her gift the evil fairy Malificent appeared
# she was so angry that she hadn't been invited that she put a curse on the baby
# before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel
# Merryweather wanted to take away Malificent's curse put her powers were not strong enough
# so she changed the curse Aurora wouldn't die but would fall into a deep sleep only true love's kiss would break the spell
# then Flaura came up with a plan the three fairies would transform themselves into peasants and raise the princess deep into the forest until her sixteenth birthday
# once the curse ended they would return her to the palace
# many years passed and Malificent had lost her patience it was almost Aurora's sixteenth birthday and she hadn't found the princess
# meanwhile Aurora had grown to be sweet and lovely on her sixteenth birthday the fairies sent her out to pick berries while they prepared a surprise party
# nearby a young prince heard Aurora's pretty voice
# what's that
# that is an owl you're right
# that's a little squirrel
# right a little bird
# Aurora and the prince met and quickly fell in love but Aurora wouldn't tell the prince her name because the fairies had warned her to never speak to strangers
# even so she invited the prince to visit their cottage that night
# back at the cottage the fairies were having trouble making Aurora Aurora's birthday present birthday party extra special
# just as Malificent's raven was flying overhead the colorful sparklers from their magic wands shot out of the cottage's chimney
# as soon as he saw the magic the raven flew back to the forbidden mountain to tell Malificent he had found the fairies and the princess
# Aurora returned home and told the fairies about the handsome stranger she'd met the fairies explained she was a princess and was promised to prince Philip then the fairies set off to return the sad princess to her home her parents
# and her parents the king and queen
# when they reached the palace the fairies left Aurora alone while they went to find her parents suddenly a strange glow appeared
# in a trance the Princess followed the light into the room with a spinning wheel in it touch the spindle the evil fairy commanded powerless the princess obeyed and pricked her finger
# soon she feel into a deep sleep
# Malificent then found the prince and locked him in her dungeon but the good fairies appeared and they realized it was prince Philip
# they gave him the magical shield of virtue and the sword of truth
# these weapons of righteousness will triumph over evil they told him
# Malificent knew prince Philip was the only one who could undo the curse
# as he approached the castle Malificent turned herself into a terrible dragon and blasted him with hot flames
# Philip threw his sword at the dragon with all his might and the beast plunged over the edge of the cliff
# prince Philip ran through the palace gates to where Aurora lay
# he knelt beside the princess and kissed her gently
# sleeping beauty awakened and smiled at the prince

# it's this weird thing so it's hard to grown but
# come sit with me
# oh boy look what we have
# Dora's backpack and the little mermaid which one should we read first
# alright the little mermaid
# wow
# mommy has to yawn she's tired
# under the sea was a bustling kingdom of mer
# Triton
# king Tritan forbade the mer
# Ariel was fascinated by the surface world and had a collection of human treasures
# she and Flounder had even made friends with a seagull named Scuttle
# one day Ariel saw a ship overhead and swam to the surface
# on board was a handsome young man called
# prince Eric
# all of a sudden a storm broke and the sky turned dark thunder boomed and lightening crashed
# howling wind tore at the ship's sails and giant waves tossed the vessel onto the jagged rocks
# prince Eric was thrown into the ocean
# Ariel frantically searched for the prince and when she spotted him she quickly swam over to him and pulled him to safety
# once they were on shore Ariel sang quietly to the unconscious prince
# at last he began to awaken minutes later the prince's servant sir Grimsby discovered him a girl rescued me said the prince groggily and she had the most beautiful voice
# she has a very pretty voice was she singing
# yeah
# who else likes to sing
# right
# who's that
# Ursula
# is she nice or is she mean
# she is mean
# meanwhile in a dark corner of the sea lay the lair of Ursula the sea witch she had been bent on destroying king Tritan ever since he had thrown her out of his kingdom
# she stared at the image of Ariel and Flounder in her crystal ball this pretty little daughter of his may be the key to Tritan's undoing she said
# when Ariel returned home Tritan was very angry with her
# never go there again he said and he
# that is his triton  he holds
# and he destroyed all of Ariel's human treasures Ariel had that Ariel had collected from the surface
# Ariel was very upset and she sought Ursula's help
# in exchange for the mermaid's voice Ursula would transform Ariel's tail into legs
# but she said the prince must fall in love with you by sunset on the third day that is he's got_to kiss you
# if not
# well she's gonna
# Ursula took her mermaid tail away and gave her legs instead right
# and if prince Eric didn't kiss her on the third day Ariel would change back into a mermaid and become Ursula's slave forever
# a short time later prince Eric and his dog Max found Ariel on the beach
# you seem very familiar to me he said have we met
# Ariel could only nod although she looked like the girl who had rescued him it Eric thought it couldn't be her because she couldn't speak much less sing
# don't worry I'll help you said Eric and he brought Ariel back to his castle
# but meanwhile Ursula hatched a plan to keep Eric from falling in love with Ariel she turned herself into a pretty girl named
# Vanessa right
# and she wore the shell containing Ariel's voice around her neck
# that evening the prince heard someone singing it was the voice of the girl who had saved him
# Eric went out to the balcony and saw Vanessa and fell under her wicked spell
# when Ariel awoke the next morning she saw Eric with Vanessa
# Ariel had lost her chance and was doomed to be Ursula's slave forever
# that's Deborah going to work
# aboard the wedding ship Scuttle saw Vanessa's reflection in the mirror and realized it was really Ursula
# Scuttle and the other seagulls did their best to interrupt the wedding by flying at Vanessa
# &-um
# this is one the ship
# a magic locket fell to the ground and shattered just as Ariel reached the ship
# &-um that looks like a little flower or something and this is some smoke maybe
# oh that's right that's the necklace that broke you're absolutely right
# it's okay
# I'll call her back
# &-um you can talk said prince you're the one it was you all the time
# happy at last the prince leaned over to kiss Ariel but seconds before the kiss the sun set
# you're too late shouted Ursula Ariel looked down and saw that her legs had changed back into a tail
# it's not you I'm after said Ursula I've got bigger fish to fry
# and at those words king Tritan appeared
# in return for his daughter's freedom the king agreed to take Ariel's place as Ursula's slave
# at last this is mine Ursula cried placing
# right that's her
# that's Ariel's daddy's crown and his triton
# Ursula grew monstrously huge but suddenly prince Eric appeared steering his ship through the raging waves right at Ursula
# and the bough of the ship pierced her cold heart slowly the horrible sea witch sank beneath the waves forever
# king Tritan's powers were restored and he realized how happy Eric and Ariel were
# with his triton  he changed Ariel's tail back into legs
# yay
# mm
# how do you ask nicely
# hm
# what's what's this one about
# Belle
# and who's that
# the beast
# a young woman named Belle lived near the castle
# Belle loved to read more than anything in the world
# who else loves to read
# you do like to read
# &-uh her father Maurice was busy working on a new invention you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow Belle predicted
# but Maurice and his horse Philippe never made it to the fair they got lost and saw a castle
# Maurice approached the castle and stepped inside
# suddenly a huge beast stormed into the room a stranger he gravled  growled and dragged Maurice into the dungeon
# at that very moment Gaston a local hunter had arrived at Belle's house to propose marriage
# say you'll marry me he said but Belle refused there was no way she'd marry that conceited bully
# Gaston left angrily
# just then Philippe arrived with no rider where's papa
# you must take me to him
# I don't suppose she's French so maybe she just said where's papa huh
# Belle rode through the forest braving the thick fog and frightening sounds when she found the castle
# I'm the master of this castle roared the beast
# that's right
# take me instead of my father said Belle
# and the beast agreed there's the beast
# there he is
# you can go anywhere you like he said to Belle except the west wing and you will join me for dinner
# back at the castle the beast waited for Belle to join him for dinner master said Lumiere this girl could be the one to break the spell
# she'll always see me as a monster grumbled the beast
# but one day at dinner the beast remembered his manners and later he and Belle shared a wonderful dance
# the beast asked Belle if she was happy
# oh yes said Belle if only I could see my father
# so the beast brought Belle a magic mirror and her father appeared in it
# but he was wondering lost in the forest you must go to him said the beast sadly but take the mirror so you can remember me
# she left the castle and found her father and brought him home
# but suddenly Gaston arrived with an angry crowd your father's crazy he think thinks he's seen a beast
# but Belle had to convince everyone her father was not crazy so she picked up the magic mirror and showed the beast to the crowd
# Gaston locked Belle and her father in the cellar and set off to find the beast
# she's in her house
# Belle and her father escaped from the cellar and also began riding towards the castle
# when Belle and her father arrived the beast had Gaston by the throat
# let me go cried Gaston and the beast felt sorry for him and released him
# that's right they are wearing capes
# &-uh oh right
# hm
# as the beast embraced Belle Gaston stabbed him in the back and the beast let out a terrible roar
# Gaston tripped and fell off the balcony and was never to be seen again
# the beast collapsed in Belle's arms you came back he said at least I got_to see you one more time
# Belle began to cry
# oh no please said Belle I love you
# and at Belle's words the beast became human again
# it's me he said to Belle and all the household servants became human too
# the spell was broken at last
# yeah

# Lily loved school
# she loved the pointy pencils she loved the squeaky chalk and she loved the way her boots went clickety clickety click down the long shiny halls
# Lily loved the privacy of her very own desk
# and she loved the fish sticks and chocolate milk every Friday in the lunch room
# and most of all she loved her teacher Mister Slinger
# Mister Slinger was sharp as a tack
# he wore artistic shirts and glasses on a chain around his neck
# and he wore a different colored tie for each day of the week
# mhm and what color's this one
# right
# wow said Lily
# that was about all she could say wow
# instead of greetings students or good morning pupils Mister Slinger winked and said howdy
# he thought that desks in rows were old fashioned and boring
# do you rodents think you can handle a semicircle
# and he always provided the most tasty snacks
# things that were curly and crunchy and cheesy
# I wanna be a teacher when I grow up said Lily
# me too said her friends
# what's on your book
# really
# maybe some crayon
# oh
# we'll have_to try and clean that off
# oh thank you
# oh very nice thanks honey
# at home Lily pretended to be Mister Slinger
# I'm the teacher she told her baby brother Julius listen up
# Lily even wanted her encyclopedias
# what's with Lily asked her mother
# I thought she wanted to be a surgeon or an ambulance driver or a diva said her father
# it must be because of her new teacher Mister Slinger said her mother
# there she is she's dressed up like Mister Slinger
# she's pretending to be Mister Slinger
# &-uh here she is
# that's her here
# whenever the students had free time they were permitted to go to the light bulb lab in the back of the classroom
# huh I don't know it must be other kids in her class
# that's Julius
# over there
# these are other students in her class
# when Mister Slinger had bus duty Lily stood in line even though she didn't ride the bus
# she raised her hand more than anyone in the class even if she didn't know the answer
# and she volunteered to stay after school to clap erasers
# you're right he is wearing a yellow tie
# one Monday morning Lily came to school especially happy
# she had gone shopping with her Grammy over the weekend and she had a new pair of movie movie star sunglasses complete with glittery diamonds and a chain like Mister Slinger's
# she had three shiny quarters and best of all she had a brand new purple plastic purse that played a jaunty tune when it was opened
# Lily wanted to show everyone
# not now said Mister Slinger listen to our story
# Lily had a hard time listening
# she really wanted to show everyone
# not now said Mister Slinger let's be considerate of our classmates
# or a diva or a pilot or a hairdresser or a scuba diver
# right
# she's giving a haircut to Julius
# oh let's see it looks like she maybe she's a pilot there she's flying
# oh she's a doctor there
# she's a ballerina there
# she's a scuba diver
# she's a diva singing
# an ambulance driver
# wow
# what do you think you want to be honey
# oh I don't know you could be
# &
# you could be
# you could work in a bank like Daddy does
# you could be a doctor
# you could be a teacher

# that would be fun don't you think

# cause I saw that it said that and I and it said for new or renovated houses and I thought I don't know if the wiring's gonna work
# right
# yeah they didn't it was the only they didn't have anything similar in the residential stuff so I just
# figured well we'll give it a whirl
# I of course would take full responsibility if it turned out it had no place in this house
# oh
# hm
# uhhuh oh oh I see
# oh god
# I still just think it's so curious that you have_to put those in and not put any decent lighting in that room
# what'r'ya lookin' at
# oh you are
# look who I brought
# blankie
# blankie
# strawberries
# the purple crayon book
# yes
# one evening after thinking it over for some time Harold decided to go for a walk in the moonlight
# there wasn't any moon and Harold needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight
# and he needed something to walk on
# he made a long straight path so he wouldn't get lost
# and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him
# but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path so he left the path for a shortcut across a field
# and the moon went with him
# the shortcut led right to where Harold thought a forest ought_to be
# he didn't want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest
# how many trees are in this forest
# yeah just one tree
# yeah just one
# it turned out to be an apple tree
# the apples would be very tasty when they got red Howard thought
# &-uh oh
# he put a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples
# he is going to scare Harold
# it was a terribly frightening dragon
# it frightened Harold and he backed away
# his hand holding the purple crayon shook
# suddenly he realized what was happening but by then Harold was over his head in an ocean
# he drew water
# but he came up thinking fast and in no time he was climbing aboard a trim little boat
# he quickly set sail
# ooh boy that's annoying huh
# op it's gone
# I think it was a car alarm
# whadda you think
# it was a car
# yeah I think so
# he quickly set sail and the moon sailed with him
# after he had sailed long enough Harold made land without too much trouble
# he stepped ashore on the beach wondering where he was
# the sandy beach reminded Harold of picnics and the thought of picnics made him hungry
# so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch
# there was nothing but
# pie
# but there were all nine kinds of pie that Harold liked best
# when Harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left
# he hated to see so much delicious pie go to waste
# so he left a very hungry
# moose and a deserving
# porcupine to finish it up
# and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was
# he knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see
# oh he's climbing up the mountain to see if he can find his bedroom
# oh he is
# let's see
# he hoped he could see the bedroom from the top of the mountain
# oh
# he looked down over the other side and he fell off
# there wasn't any other side to the mountain
# he was falling into
# thin air
# but luckily he kept his wits and his purple crayon
# and he made a hot air balloon and grabbed on
# he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in
# he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn't see his window
# he couldn't even see his house
# so he made a house with windows and landed the balloon on the grass in the front yard
# none of the windows was his window though
# he tried to think where his window ought_to be
# oh it must be in back of the house I bet it's back behind the house right
# yeah
# he made some more windows
# he made a big building full of windows
# he made lots_of buildings full of windows
# he made a whole city of windows
# but none of the windows was his window
# and he couldn't think where it might be
# he decided to ask a policeman
# the policeman pointed the way Harold was going anyway but Harold thanked him
# and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in his bed
# then
# he remembered
# he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon
# it was always right around the moon
# yeah the window is right around the moon
# then Harold made his bed and got in and drew up the covers
# the purple crayon dropped on the floor and Harold
# dropped off to sleep
# very good sweetie
# very good
# yeah you did
# yeah
# where did you watch Harold
# Harold was on tv
# really
# in our house
# oh
# yes
# there we go now he's on the ground
# I'm not sure where he is now
# ooh look at your pin

# in that wall not far from the barn and the granary a chatty field of
# a chatty family of field mice had their
# home
# but the farmers had moved away the barn was abandoned and the granary stood empty
# since winter was not far off the little mice began to gather corn and nuts and wheat and straw

# they were a happy family
# but little by little they had nibbled up most of the nuts and berries the straw was gone
# oh yes yes it is
# the corn was only a memory
# it was cold in the wall and no one felt like chatting
# &
# well they're inside the stones of the wall
# well it's all around that's part of the wall right here
# right here
# right
# you think they're kind of sad
# then they remembered what Frederick had said about sun rays and colors and words
# what about your supplies Frederick they asked
# close your eyes said Frederick as he climbed onto a big stone
# now I send you the rays of the sun
# do you feel how their golden glow
# and as Frederick spoke of the sun the four little mice began to feel warmer
# was it Frederick's voice
# was it magic
# and how about the colors Frederick they asked anxiously
# close your eyes again Frederick said and when he told them of the blue periwinkles the red poppies and the yellow wheat and the green leaves of the berry bush they saw the colors as clearly as if they had been painted in their minds
# right and purple
# you're squeezing the colors in your hands
# you're mushing the colors up into your hands
# wow
# and the words Frederick
# Frederick cleared his throat and then as if from a stage he said
# who scatters the snowflakes who melts the ice
# who spoils the weather who makes it
# who grows the four leaf clovers in June
# who dims the daylight who lights the
# four little field mice who live in the sky
# four little field mice like
# one is the spring mouse who turns on the showers then comes the summer who paints in the
# the fall mouse is next with walnuts and wheat and winter is last with little
# aren't we lucky the seasons are four
# think of a year with one less
# that's so great Honey
# when Frederick had finished they all applauded
# but Frederick they said
# you are a poet
# Frederick blushed
# took a bow and said shyly

# one morning Ariel the Little_Mermaid went looking for hidden treasure with her best friend
# Flounder
# Ariel was supposed to sing for the first time in front of her father king Triton and all the other mer
# but for now she was much more interested in sunken ships than her father's concert
# while they were searching Flounder began to get nervous
# what was that he said
# did you hear something
# suddenly a very large
# shark smashed through the side of the ship
# swim a shark Flounder cried
# they swam away very quickly
# Ariel and Flounder found a safe spot where the shark couldn't reach them
# you big bully Flounder shouted at the shark
# as soon as she was sure they were a safe distance from the shark Ariel thanked Flounder for being so brave
# even though he was a very small fish he had a very big heart and he was Ariel's best friend under the sea
# after their adventure Ariel and Flounder headed home hoping that they would not be too late for her father's concert
# ooh it's a big concert
# what's the octopus playing
# right
# and what's Sebastian doing
# what is he
# he's the conductor and he's conducting the orchestra

# The Dance lesson
# just imagine said Cinderella excitedly there's a ball at the palace tonight in honor of the prince and every maiden in the land is invited
# that means me too
# all of Cinderella's friends clapped and chirped as they gathered around
# they loved their Cinderellee
# oh dear said Cinderella with a sigh there's so much to do
# I can only go if I've finished my chores and today Stepmother has given me more work than ever
# there's washing mending ironing cooking scrubbing sweeping
# suddenly three loud shrieks came from downstairs
# Cinderella come down here immediately and help us get ready for the ball her stepsisters cried
# her cruel stepmother and stepsisters wouldn't give poor Cinderella any time to do the rest of her chores
# mend my dress screeched Anastasia
# polish my shoes whined Rosella
# iron my cloak demanded her stepmother
# are they nice
# no they're not so nice
# but is Cinderella nice
# she's nice
# and are Cinderella's friends nice
# yes
# hours later Cinderella began to sweep and scrub the endless stone floor
# suddenly Jack had an idea
# I know he said
# we'll help Cinderella
# all the other mice nodded in agreement
# what would I do without you she said patting each of them on the head
# you're so good to me
# everyone joined in the cleaning singing happily as they went
# as she worked Cinderella began to imagine the magical evening ahead
# everyone would be dressed in the finest clothes and Cinderella would wear her mother's beautiful gown
# the ballroom would come alive with music dancing and laughter and the prince would bow before Cinderella and ask her to dance
# suddenly Cinderella stopped dreaming
# oh no she cried I've never been to a ball
# I don't even know how to dance
# dontchu worry Cinderella Jacques smiled reassuringly
# we'll show you 0how to dance easy as pie
# with that Jack bowed before Perla and extended his hand
# dance please Missy he asked
# Perla blushed as she took Jack's hand
# Gus was the conductor and he got all the birds to sing
# Jack and Perla spun round and around gliding across the floor
# Cinderella watched and copied their movements
# just listen and move see said Perla
# not so scary
# using her broom as an imaginary partner Cinderella danced and twirled gracefully through the room
# she led everyone across the floor sweeping and cleaning as they went
# good Cinderella said Jack beaming
# lucky prince gets to dance with Cinderellee
# the mice collapsed on the floor laughing

# oh there's Ariel
# a Special surprise
# the underwater kingdom was quiet and peaceful
# every mermaid and merman was in bed fast asleep
# everyone except princess Ariel and her friend Flounder
# hurry up Flounder cried Ariel
# it's almost time for the party
# we can't be late
# trying not to make sound Ariel and Flounder swam away from king Triton's palace
# they began their journey toward the surface
# but Ariel said Flounder are you sure we should go to the surface
# remember last time
# your father got so angry
# you know how he feels about humans
# that's right this time we can't get caught said Ariel
# she wasn't to let anything ruin her plans for tonight
# prince Eric the prince Ariel had saved in a shipwreck was having a royal ball
# and Ariel had a very special surprise for him
# swim faster Flounder she cried glancing back at him
# and Flounder raced to catch up
# just as Ariel and Flounder approached the surface Ariel saw beautiful lights dance across the water
# I don't think anyone's wearing yellow there are they
# no
# what do you think's happening
# well I guess prince Eric is out on the balcony
# he just didn't feel like joining in the royal celebration
# he cou
# Melody is crying
# yeah

# when they had the party for Melody she didn't wanna be at the party either did she
# she just wanted to go swimming right
# yeah
# she went back in the sea again
# yeah
# she was happy there right
# did she go with Sebastian
# yeah
# Sebastian fell in the water again
# yeah
# prince Eric stood on the palace balcony
# he couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious girl with the lovely voice who had saved his life
# Flounder spotted the prince first
# look Ariel he said pointing a fin at the castle
# Ariel's heart leapt with joy when she saw Prince_Eric
# it's time for my surprise she said winking at Flounder
# swimming up to a nearby rock Ariel and Flounder hid behind it
# ready asked Flounder
# with a nod Ariel closed her eyes opened her mouth and began to sing
# suddenly the night was filled with the sweet sound of Ariel's voice
# she sang a song she had written just for Eric
# it was Ariel's special gift for him
# hearing her beautiful voice again Eric's face lit up
# it can't be he said
# I must be hearing the sounds of the wind
# still he remained on the balcony enchanted by the beautiful song
# when the song was over Eric looked out across the sea
# he hoped to catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl who had saved him
# who are you he called out into the night
# but all he heard was the echo of his own voice
# I'll be back soon Ariel whispered as she and Flounder swam toward home
# what are you doing silly
# you're all tangled up in the wire
# let me get you untangled

# what's Corduroy looking for
# I donno
# tadah
# tadah
# tadah
# oh my gosh what do you say
# you're welcome
# please
# hm
# what's this book about
# Corduroy
# is Corduroy a little bear
# what's he wearing
# is he wearing overalls
# yes
# what color are they
# oh
# late one summer afternoon Lisa and her mother took their laundry to the laundromat
# as always on such trips Lisa took along her toy bear Corduroy
# a laundromat was a busy place at this hour
# now Corduroy you sit right here and wait for me Lisa said
# I'm going to help with our wash
# Corduroy waited patiently
# Lisa's mother was saying be sure to take everything out of your pockets Lisa dear
# you don't want your precious things to get all wet and soapy
# pockets said Corduroy to himself
# I don't have a pocket
# he slid off the chair
# I must go find something to make a pocket out of he said and he began to look around
# first he came to a pile of fancy towels and wash
# then he saw a huge stack of colorful clothes in a laundry basket
# there ought_to be something in there to make a pocket out of he said
# without hesitating he climbed inside the bag which was filled with pieces of wet laundry
# the dampness didn't bother Corduroy in the least
# this must be a cave he said sighing happily
# I've always wanted to live in a dark cool cave
# when the time came for Lisa to fetch her bear he was gone
# oh Mommy she said Corduroy isn't here where I left him
# I'm sorry Honey said her mother but the Laundromat will be closing soon and we must be getting home
# Lisa was reluctant to leave without Corduroy but her mother insisted
# you can come back tomorrow she said
# I'm sure he will still be here
# as they left a young man wearing an artist's beret was taking his wet laundry out of a bag
# before he knew it Corduroy was being tossed together with all the sheets and shirts and shorts and slacks
# into the dryer
# but just as the artist was shutting the glass door Corduroy tumbled out onto the floor
# how in thunder did that bear ever get mixed up with my things the artist wondered
# poor Corduroy was damp all over
# the least I can do for him is give his overalls a good drying said the man thoughtfully
# he unbuttoned Corduroy's shoulder straps and put his overalls in the dryer
# Corduroy grew dizzy as he watched the clothes spinning round but the artist became inspired
# this would make a wonderful painting he said as he took out his sketch pad and began drawing the swirling colors
# I can hardly wait to get back to my studio
# finally the dryer stopped whirling and the man gathered up the clothes
# and he helped Corduroy put on his warm dry overalls
# all at once the manager of the laundromat called closing time everybody out
# Corduroy was gently placed on top of a washing machine
# I wonder who that bear belongs to said the artist as he was leaving
# it seems to me he should have his name someplace
# he's too fine a fellow to be lost
# as soon as the lights were turned off Corduroy began searching
# began his search again
# he was surprised to see something white glowing in the dark
# what is it
# maybe it's snow he said
# I've always wanted to play in the snow
# he accidentally tipped over the open lidded box and suddenly he was covered in soft slippery soap flakes
# it's soap
# gradually Corduroy began to slip and slide
# what fun he said with a smile
# I've always wanted to ski down a steep mountainside
# he landed paws first in an empty laundry basket
# this must be a cage he said
# I've never wanted to live inside a cage
# but by now Corduroy was drowsy and soon he nodded off to
# oh he's sleeping
# next morning when the manager came to open the door of the laundromat Lisa was waiting
# I left something here yesterday she said
# may I look around
# certainly said the manager
# my customers are always leaving things
# Lisa was searching under the chairs and in back of the washing machines when he
# when he
# when she heard the manager call her
# is this whatchor looking for senorita
# yes he's my best friend shouted Lisa as she came running
# she reached in and picked Corduroy out of the basket
# so this is where you've been you little rascal she said
# it's time I took you home
# Lisa thanked the manager and ran out of the door down the street holding Corduroy tightly in her arms
# why did you wander away she said
# I went looking for a pocket said Corduroy
# oh Corduroy why didn't you tell me you wanted a pocket asked Lisa giving him an affectionate squeeze
# the very next morning Lisa sewed a pocket on Corduroy's overalls
# and here's a card I've made with your name on it for you to keep tucked inside
# that's his little pocket
# I've always wanted a purple pocket with my name inside said Corduroy as he and Lisa nuzzled noses
# that's some thread
# that Lisa used to sew the pocket on
# wow
# that's great
# well you want Mommy to pick it out
# oh you wanna pick it out
# okay
# you have_to carry your box
# you want me to hold your milk
# okay
# what would be a good book to read
# are those good to read

# oh_goodness
# because a camel might wear it in the wrong place
# what's he wearing on his humps
# hats where should he be wearing the hats
# that's right
# because a snake would lose it
# he's losing his pants
# oh my he needs to put his pants on
# because a mouse could get lost in a hat
# oh my gosh
# because a sheep might find it terribly hot
# oh that sheep is sweating he's so hot
# he's panting
# I'm so hot
# because it could be very messy for a pig

# he went swimming and his clothes got all wet
# because a moose could never manage
# he got his antlers stuck in his suspenders
# oh my gosh
# because possums might wear it upside down by mistake
# because possums like to hang upside down
# but most of all because it might be very embarrassing
# the elephant is wearing the same dress as the woman

# sure
# remember what this one's called
# what's it called
# beauty
# and the beast
# long ago an enchantress cast a spell on a castle and she transformed the handsome young prince into a hideous beast
# and his servants into household objects
# just look at me grumbled the beast I've been so cruel holding Belle captive in my castle how will she ever see me as anything but a monster
# come now said Mrs Pots gently all you have_to do is show her what's inside your heart you must act like a gentleman Lumiere said
# be romantic compliment her and most of all be kind gentle and sincere
# and don't be so grumpy added Chip Mrs Pots young son
# Mrs Pots gave her son a stern look but they all knew Chip was right
# who's that
# Lumiere
# I have an idea said the beast smiling why don't I invite Belle to go on a sleigh ride
# it just snowed outside and she might like the fresh air
# perfect said Lumiere a wonderful idea agreed Mrs Pots
# very romantic
# bless you
# added Chip that's enough out of you Mrs Pots said to Chip trying not to smirk
# the beast Lumiere to extend his invitation
# that sounds lovely said Belle I've been stuck in this castle far too long
# she ran down the long staircase and stepped outside
# glimmering white snow flakes fell from the sky it was a perfect white day
# just then the beast pulled up in a gleaming horse drawn sleigh
# how beautiful exclaimed Belle
# the beast smiled as he took her hand and helped her into the sleigh
# he didn't mention he had slept all morning polishing it just for her
# once she was settled he covered her with a warm blanket
# they took off across the powdery snow Belle laughed happily as the beast guided the sleigh through the forest path
# soon they came to a clearing in the woods before then was a frozen pond
# the beast pulled on the reins and stopped at the the edge of the pond
# this is such a magical place said Belle how did you ever find it
# I used to come here long ago said the beast it was one of y favorite places and I wanted to share it with you
# then the beast took out a picnic basket filled with snacks
# what are they eating
# they have hot chocolate
# and cookies
# right and
# and fruit and bread too
# that sounds like a good snack doesn't it
# mm yummy
# when they had finished their meal the beast asked Belle if she wanted to ice skate
# oh yes she said father and I used to go every winter I love ice skating
# soon Belle was spinning effortlessly across the pond's smooth surface
# the beast was less graceful hitting a bump in the ice he lost his balance and toppled to the ground
# at first he was angry but then he saw Belle looking at him kindly
# remembering his friends' advice he smiled as Belle helped him to his feet
# every one falls sometimes said Belle it's part of learning
# before long they were gliding across the ice arm in arm enjoying each other's company in the crisp winter air
# they grew tired and decided to rest
# just then a timid fawn wandered out of the forest
# poor thing said Belle she looks scared and hungry
# taking an apple from their picnic basket Belle showed the beast how to gently feed the young deer
# soon the sun was setting it was time to go as they made their way home Belle thought about the day she had spent with the beast
# there was something different about him he had shown her a kinder softer side
# perhaps they could be friends after all
# is that what comes next
# oh
# what's this one called
# right is it called the dance lesson
# mm
# how do you ask nicely
# just imagine said Cinderella excitedly there's a ball at the palace tonight in honor of the prince
# and every maiden in the land is invited
# that means me too
# all of Cinderella's friends clapped and chirped as they gathered around
# they loved their Cinderella
# oh dear said Cinderella with a sigh there's so much to do
# I can only go if I finish my chores
# and today step mother has given me more work than ever
# there's washing mending ironing cooking scrubbing sweeping
# suddenly three loud shrieks came from downstairs
# Cinderella come down here immediately and help us get ready for the ball he step sisters cried
# mend my dress polish my shoes iron my cloak
# hours later Cinderella began to sweep and scrub the endless stone floor
# suddenly Jacques had an idea
# I know he said we'll help Cinderella and all the other mice nodded in agreement
# what would I do without you Cinderella said patting them on the head you're so good to me
# everyone joined in the cleaning singing happily as they went
# as she worked Cinderella began to imagine the magical evening ahead
# everyone would be dressed in the the finest clothes Cinderella would wear her mother's beautiful gown
# the ballroom would come alive with music dancing and laughter and the handsome young prince would bow before Cinderella and ask her to dance
# suddenly Cinderella stopped dreaming oh no she said I've never been to a ball I don't even know how to dance
# don't worry Cinderella Jacques smiled reassuringly
# we'll show you how to dance easy as pie
# with that Jacques bowed before Perla and extended his hand
# dance please he asked Perla blushed as she took Jaques' hand
# Gus was the conductor he got all the birds to sing
# Jacques and Perla spun around and around gliding across the floor
# honey is the mouse's name Jack or Jacques
# it's Jacques and Gus
# okay
# Cinderella watched and then copied their movements
# just listen and move see said Perla not so scary
# using her broom as an imaginary partner Cinderella danced and twirled gracefully through the room she led everyone across the floor sweeping and cleaning as they went
# good Cinderella said Jacques beaming a lucky prince gets to dance with Cinderelli
# and the mice collapsed on the floor laughing thank you so much Cinderella said to her friends
# with your help tonight might be the night all my dreams come true
# it is Ariel next look at that
# a special surprise
# is Ariel swimming
# who's she swimming with
# flounder wow
# are they friends
# please
# the underwater kingdom was quiet and peaceful
# every mermaid and merman were in bed fast asleep
# everyone but princess Ariel and her friend flounder
# hurry up flounder cried Ariel it's almost time for the party we can't be late
# trying not to make a sound Ariel and flounder swam away from king Triton's palace
# they began their journey towards the surface but Ariel said flounder are you sure we should go to the surface
# remember the last time your father got so angry
# you know how he feels about humans
# that's why this time
# okay
# oh you need blankie oopy
# got it
# okay
# yes
# prince Eric the prince Ariel had saved in a ship wreck was having a royal ball
# Ariel had a very special surprise for him
# swim faster flounder she cried flounder raced to keep up
# just as Ariel and flounder approached the surface Ariel saw beautiful lights dance across the water
# when they poked their heads out of the water Ariel and flounder saw colorful lights explode in the air above prince Eric's castle
# I've never seen anything so beautiful in all my life said Ariel
# the human world is a wonderful place
# sure is pretty said flounder
# do you think prince Eric is happy
# or do you
# think he's sad
# he's happy oh good
# off in the distance prince Eric stood on the palace balcony
# he couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious girl with the lovely voice who had saved his life in the ship wreck
# why has she disappeared he wondered
# flounder spotted the prince first
# look Ariel he said
# Ariel's heart leapt with joy when she saw prince Eric
# it's time for my surprise she said winking at flounder
# swimming up to a nearby rock Ariel and flounder hid behind it
# ready asked flounder
# with a nod Ariel closed her eyes opened her mouth and began to sing
# do you need me to get blankie honey
# what's blankie doing
# he's on
# the ground
# oh my
# gosh what's he doing on the ground
# you can't reach blankie
# you gonna go find blankie and bring him home
# please
# okay let me put it back on for you
# you have_to hold onto it
# be gentle with it don't hurt it
# what do you say into your microphone
# hello
# how are
# you
# what's new
# can you say hi Amanda
# should we keep reading
# gentle with that okay
# suddenly the night was filled with the sweet sound of Ariel's voice
# she sang a song she had written just for Eric
# it was Ariel's special gift to him
# hearing her beautiful voice again Eric's face lit up
# it can't be he said I must be hearing the sounds of the wind
# still he remained on the balcony enchanted by the beautiful song filling the night air
# when the song was over Eric looked down across the sea
# he hoped to catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl who had saved him
# who are you he called but all he heard was the echo of his own voice
# I'll be back soon Ariel whispered
# just wait and see
# okay
# whatever could be keeping the dwarves said Snow White
# it's getting late
# and they should be home from the diamond mine by now
# while she waited Snow White busied herself tidying up the cottage in the woods
# what messy little fellows she said
# just then Happy came through the front door
# he tugged on Snow White's long yellow skirt
# what
# Snow White he said come quickly a young deer is hurt in the woods
# oh no cried Snow White the poor thing we must hurry
# they soon reached a small clearing and everyone stood in a circle around the deer
# do you know what the dwarves' names are
# well I think there's Happy
# and there's Grumpy he looks Grumpy right
# and that's Dopey
# and that's Sneezy he's always sneezing
# that's Doc he's the doctor
# and there's Bashful
# and there's Sleepy I think
# is so sleepy sleepy
# he is yawning cause he's so tired
# oh
# to take a nap he's so tired
# he must be cold said Snow White covering the deer with her long cape
# maybe he's just tired said Sleepy yawning
# a nice long rest should do the trick
# mommy's yawning too
# what a big yawn
# well you could be right Sleepy said Snow White but
# he's not closing eyes
# his eyes
# and that's Dopey right
# yeah
# maybe he has a hachoo a cold said Sneezy
# he looks like he might be a little bit stuffy
# well that's possible but he probably would've stayed in his thicket until he was feeling better said Snow White
# I know said Happy maybe he's feeling sad and needs a little cheering up
# I'm sure that would help Happy but it looks like he may need something more than a merry story or a song
# I I don't know for sure said Bashful softly
# but perhaps he's too shy to let us know what's the matter
# we all feel shy sometimes don't we Bashful said Snow White
# then Dopey started pacing back and forth and pointing over his shoulder
# hm said Snow White you could be right Dopey
# he could be lost
# I bet I know what happened grumbled Grumpy
# the wicked queen probably cast a spell on him
# she's always up to no good
# suddenly Doc pushed his way past the others and approached the deer
# may I lake a took
# I mean take a look he said adjusting his eye glasses
# and he knelt down beside the deer
# well would you look at that cried Doc
# the poor deer must have stepped on a
# a thorn ouch
# Doc gently removed the sharp thorn and the deer jumped up and licked him
# how relieved you must be cried Snow White
# now run along home she said to her new friend your family must be worried
# the deer licked Snow White's hand and ran into the forest
# that's the deer
# oh &-uh the bushes you mean
# yeah
# that's the deer's ear
# this is
# these are the bushes the green bushes you mean
# that's just the sky
# yeah that's
# the sky see there's a bush there and then the
# all the yellow stuff even behind him there is the sky
# right
# that's a little piece of sky
# right
# I'm so proud of each and every one of you
# said Snow White
# the sky is on him
# oh no
# he's got
# he's got a spotted fur
# he
# yeah
# that night Snow White and the seven dwarves made a delicious dinner
# then when they had all had their fill they sang and dances until it was time for bed
# yey
# oh what's this one about
# it's about Jasmine and what's his name
# Aladdin
# Aladdin and Jasmine had just gotten married
# people had come from near and far to celebrate
# it had been the largest wedding in the history of Agraba
# now Aladdin and Jasmine were preparing to take a trip far far away
# Abu stay out of those bags warned Aladdin smiling at his curious little friend
# that food is for our trip
# Jasmine's going to be so surprised when she sees what I've planned
# she has lived most of her life within the walls of this palace and now we are going to see the world together
# soon Aladdin and Jasmine stood on the balcony ready to begin their adventure
# the magic carpet awaits you said Aladdin
# you're going to see things you've never seen before a whole new exciting world Aladdin replied
# let's get going said Jasmine I can't wait
# Jasmine Aladdin and Abu settled on the magic carpet
# then they took off soaring high above the palace
# Jasmine laughed with delight the wind blowing her long hair behind her
# look how small everything looks she said
# it's like a dream
# after a little while the magic carpet began its descent
# are we there asked Jasmine
# almost said Aladdin
# close your eyes I want this to be a surprise
# suddenly the magic carpet landed on top of a high cliff and Jasmine heard a noise that sounded like crashing water
# oh what is it
# it's water it's the ocean
# Jasmine couldn't believe her eyes she'd never seen anything so beautiful
# the water was a brilliant shade of turquoise and dolphins leapt in and out of the water as if they were dancing
# huge ocean waves crashed onto a white sandy beach
# in the distance
# she have a skirt on
# did
# we see the ocean when we were with Tamar and Rafi on the beach
# yeah and we saw the crashing waves
# we saw waves
# there
# another wave and
# what kind of birds did we see
# what kind of birds were we chasing on the beach
# seagulls you're right
# right
# they flew away we didn't catch them
# right
# and did we play on the beach too
# yeah and did we go to the library with Tamar
# that was fun wasn't it
# hm
# they had a wonderful time swimming and enjoying the sun and
# when he and Jasmine were ready to go Aladdin snapped his fingers
# time for our next destination he said
# within seconds the magic carpet appeared
# once again Aladdin asked Jasmine to cover her eyes as they descended Jasmine felt the air grow colder
# okay Jasmine you can open your eyes now
# what did they see
# snow
# what is it Jasmine asked bending down to touch the cold white powder
# it's snow answered Aladdin isn't it wonderful
# it falls from the sky when it's cold
# it's amazing cried Jasmine it looks like a soft white cloud
# watch out she called Abu had thrown a snowball and it was headed straight for Aladdin
# they spent the rest of the day playing in the snow and built snow
# they even used the magic carpet as a sled to slide down a nearby hill
# soon the sun began to set and the air grew tolder  colder
# I think it's time to take off said Aladdin
# you show me places so different from Agraba
# there are plenty of brand new worlds for us to share said Jasmine
# and as they made their way back to the palace Jasmine smiled
# she knew this was just the beginning of their wonderful life together
# it was
# time to go right it was getting late
# yeah
# they
# need to go to sleep right
# I hope they ate their dinner already
# do you think they did
# and they danced too
# and
# and
# right you
# right
# is that what you do before you go to bed you dance
# yeah
# oh no
# they crashed into the snow
# and then
# you got a leaf in your hair
# who did
# you
# did who crashed into the snow
# was it the Brute family
# the little
# chicks
# you're so silly
# that's from a
# like some of the stuff that she says all just comes from books that she's read like

# kay Franklin's class trip
# Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
# he had gone with his class to the bakery the fire station and the pet store
# today Franklin's class was going to the museum
# Franklin was so excited that he could hardly eat his breakfast
# the museum had lots_of steps and huge doors
# wow said Franklin it's big
# it has to be said Beaver there are real dinosaurs in there
# do you remember in New York we went with grandma and grandpa to the museum with the dinosaurs
# yeah that's called the museum of natural history in New_York
# Beaver had been to the museum before she knew everything about it
# big dinosaurs she emphasized
# so big that they ate trees for breakfast
# Franklin was afraid to ask what dinosaurs ate for lunch
# Franklin sat down on the steps
# what's wrong asked Snail
# Beaver says there are real dinosaurs in the museum
# Snail looked alarmed
# that sounds scary
# and Franklin nodded
# we're not gonna get that
# in the museum lobby Mister_Owl went over the rules
# no shouting no running and stay with the group
# Mister_Owl said Beaver one more thing
# watch out for the dinosaurs
# Moose and Bear laughed
# but Franklin didn't he moved a little closer to Mister_Owl
# their first stop was the bat cave
# it was dark inside
# squeaks and squawks filled the air
# what's that asked Franklin
# Beaver giggled
# that's the sound bats make to find their way around
# Franklin was relieved that it was bats and not dinosaurs
# the class visited the rainforest next
# Franklin climbed high into a tree house
# he could see the tops of trees
# can you spot any dinosaurs asked Snail
# Franklin shook his head and climbed down quickly
# there was so much to do in the museum that Franklin almost forgot about the dinosaurs
# in the medieval room Franklin had fun dressing up like a knight
# yeah
# Franklin even got_to dig in a sandy pit
# he was the first one to find an arrow head
# it was just like being a real archaeologist
# wow that's neat
# an archaeologist is when you dig in the sand for very old things
# yeah
# the best part is still to come said Beaver as they sat down in the cafeteria
# yes agreed Bear lunch
# Mister_Owl smiled I think Beaver means the dinosaur exhibit
# Franklin gulped I'm too tired to see more I think I'll stay here a while he muttered
# me too said Snail
# you'll forget about being tired when you see the dinosaurs said Mister_Owl
# eat up and let's go
# reluctantly Franklin and Snail followed the giant footprints down a long leafy corridor
# there was a loud roar
# the floor shook and so did Franklin
# ah
# screamed Franklin when he turned the corner
# he was looking right into the bony mouth of a tyrannosaurus
# Franklin blinked
# they're bones
# real dinosaur bones
# but the dinosaurs aren't even alive
# alive giggled Beaver of course not
# there hasn't been a live dinosaur for millions of years
# you sure make good jokes Franklin
# you sure do said Snail
# as they were leaving Franklin and his friends walked past the egyp
# the egyptian exhibit
# next time said Beaver you should visit the tomb there's a mummy inside
# is it real asked Franklin
# yeah and it's scary said Beaver
# but Franklin wasn't scared
# he had a mummy at home
# and he har could hardly wait to tell her all about his adventures at the museum
# yay

# terrific
# oh thank you very much Honey
# thank you
# next to the tv where it belongs
# phew that was hard work
# phew
# &
# &
# &
# okay Franklin rides a bike
# Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run
# he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swings
# but Franklin had a problem
# what was Franklin's problem
# right
# he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels right
# right
# in the spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes
# Beaver was the brave one
# she took her extra wheels off first
# she practiced and practiced and then went to the park to show off
# look at me she said I can ride my bike all by myself
# Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles
# who's that
# Rabbit and who's that
# Bear
# right
# it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other
# soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels
# we're going on a picnic said Bear come on
# Franklin was worried that his friends would make fun of his training wheels
# so he lied and said I'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone
# &
# poor Franklin
# what's Franklin doing in this picture
# what's he doing here
# what's he doing there
# Sweetie
# is he on the slide
# he's on the swing you're right
# afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike
# he wanted to ride all by himself
# he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
# Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and fell into the flower bed
# I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
# &
# poor Franklin
# for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out
# he watched as his friends rode off without him
# they were becoming great explorers on their bikes
# what are they doing
# they're getting ice cream cones
# what kind of ice cream are they eating
# you don't know
# whaddya think
# what's your favorite kind of ice cream
# really
# do you like vanilla
# you like chocolate ice cream
# mm
# in an ice cream cone that sounds great
# you like strawberry too
# mm what color is strawberry ice cream
# orange I think strawberry ice cream is pink
# see
# see I think maybe that's strawberry
# that's strawberry right
# yeah I don't have any though
# I'm sorry to say
# maybe we can go later to get ice cream whaddya think
# kay
# on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house
# that looks like fun said Franklin's mother
# I can't ride without my training wheels groaned Franklin
# &
# did you give it your best effort asked his mother
# well said Franklin
# hm let's see
# it looks like some little schmutz maybe from your granola bar
# maybe it's your sticky granola bar
# well
# your granola bar has a raspberry center so maybe that's what it was
# what Sweetie
# you wanna sip
# yes
# ah
# that is delicious
# that tastes delicious right
# strawberry water
# you're silly
# you gave me a kiss on the head
# you know what
# I love you
# I love your kisses
# I see you little blankie girl
# I see you
# there you are
# are you hiding
# yes
# yes I can
# well said Franklin maybe I can try one more time
# Franklin sat on his bike it's tippy he said
# his mother held on to the seat
# try it I won't let you go until you tell me to
# Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bike from behind
# he felt unsteady and very unsure
# I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling
# riding a bike is difficult said his mother
# but you can't give up just because it's frustrating
# it's too hard for me said Franklin
# it was easy for my friends
# do you think everything comes easy for them she asked
# Franklin had to think about that
# that's a little mouse what's he doing
# oh you're right he is riding his bicycle
# Franklin went to the park
# he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars
# each time she got_to the third rung she fell into the sand below
# no Beaver said Bear do it like this it's easy
# easy for you said Beaver she tried once more and fell again
# maybe tomorrow she grumbled
# Franklin remembered when Badger learned to swim
# she was afraid to put her head underwater
# it's easy said Franklin just do it
# Badger sputtered and cried
# it took her a long time to feel good in the water
# now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other
# where is Snail
# I don't think Snail is in this book
# Snail's in the other book
# Snail's at the museum right
# in the other book
# Mommy's gonna hafta get a hard candy because I can't stop coughing
# maybe that would help me stop coughing whaddya think
# let's look over
# here
# you wanna pretend to eat one
# let's see
# pretend to eat one
# Mommy's gonna have one of these
# yeah
# but Honey you can't really eat it because it's dangerous for a little girl to eat hard candy
# right
# maybe you'd like something else to eat
# can you pretend with the wrapper on then
# it's gonna make your hand all sticky
# really
# no
# no
# hello
# really
# hm
# okay
# in my mouth
# can I get you something else to eat
# hm
# there's a blue one
# looks like a blue wrapper to me
# mm hm

# mhm other way
# yep just like that
# wait
# just like that like put your hand on it
# hm like that
# turn that around
# just like this
# just tw hang on
# good job Sweetie look
# just a twist like that
# right
# just like that
# exactly
# mhm
# maybe you don't wanna hold it
# maybe you wanna put it back in the wrapper
# hm
# your hand's gonna get all sticky
# hm don't eat it
# good pretending
# Franklin thought about the first time Fox played baseball
# he couldn't hit the ball at all
# but he tried and tried until one day Fox got a home run
# who's at
# Porcupine
# just then Porcupine came by
# she moved very slowly
# she pointed to the pads on her knees wrists and elbows
# they make me feel funny she said but they keep me safe
# that's it cried Franklin and hurried home
# oh I think Porcupine's nice now
# don't you think Porcupine's nice
# the bear
# why think the bear's mean
# uhuh
# no the bear's Franklin's friend
# they're all nice animals
# mhm
# yep Porcupine's nice
# Badger is nice
# and Bear is nice and Franklin is nice
# mm that's not Badger who is that
# is that Badger
# let me see
# oh Beaver sorry that's Beaver
# Beaver
# what's Beaver doing
# what's Beaver playing with
# is he on the swing
# he's in the sandbox wow neat
# that's great
# that's good pretending
# Franklin put on padding
# he lined the walk with old pillows
# I'm ready to try again Franklin told his mother
# now I won't worry if I fall
# Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat
# Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and fell many times but he never gave up
# then it happened
# Franklin told his mother to let go
# he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash
# way to go cheered his mother
# careful Honey
# Franklin was thrilled
# finally he was riding his bike all by himself
# I can do it he shouted and rode to the park to show his friends
# look at me he called
# Franklin tried to signal with one hand like Beaver but he toppled over
# I think I'll work on that he laughed
# not everything is as easy at it looks
# hm where is it
# it is

# Max that's right
# my two closest friends here both had babies two days apart
# they were both in women and infants so I went
# I went down the hall and saw one went down the hall and saw the other one
# two baby boys
# and I was so convinced that
# back to Nordstrom's
# I was so shocked I couldn't believe it
# yes what should we read
# yeah
# I had never seen the movie I didn't realize it was kind of a downer
# every morning as the sun peeks over the horizon a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light
# this is Pride rock
# home my good friend king Mufasa and his lovely wife queen Sarabi
# on this particular morning animals from all over the Pride lands had journeyed to Pride rock in honor
# to to honor the birth of their newborn cub Simba
# one of the doctors that my grandmother had actually
# but like that's not his name I mean not to his face but like just us
# yes I can yes I can
# as part of the celebration I had a special duty I cracked open a gourd dipped my finger inside and made a mark on Simba's forehead
# and I lifted the future king up high for all to see
# not far from the ceremony in a cave at the backside of Pride rock a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled life's not fair I shall never be king
# this was Mufasa's brother Scar who was jealous of Simba's position as the next king
# moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave
# Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba you should have been first in line
# I was first in line until the little hair ball born and with that Scar stalked out of the cave
# before long Simba grew into a healthy playful young cub
# early one morning he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock
# as they looked out at the rising sun Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands
# look Simba everything the light touches is our kingdom
# what about that shadowy place said Simba
# that's beyond our borders you must never go there Simba
# later as Simba headed back to the path he ran into Scar
# hey uncle Scar guess what I'm going to be king of Pride rock my dad showed me the whole kingdom
# he didn't show you what's beyond the rise at the northern borders said Scar
# well no he said I can't go there
# oh he's right only the bravest lions go there said Scar
# when Simba returned home he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi
# come on said Simba I just heard about this great place
# Simba pounced on Nala and Nala flipped Simba on his back
# they tumbled down the hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones
# we're way beyond the boundary of Pride ro
# of the Pride lands said Nala
# and we're in danger
# suddenly three hyenas slithered out of the eye sockets of an elephant skull
# a trio of trespassers said the hyenas
# while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom
# I'm very disappointed in you Simba you deliberately disobeyed me he said
# I was just trying to be brave like you
# being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble said Mufasa
# Dad we're pals right we'll always be together won't we
# Simba said Mufasa let me tell you something my father told me
# look at the stars the great kings of the past look down on us from the stars
# so whenever you feel alone just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
# meanwhile Scar went to visit the hyenas
# I practically gift wrapped those cubs for you and you couldn't even dispose of them
# Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared for the death of the king
# the following day Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge
# when they arrived Scar turned to his young nephew
# your father has a marvelous surprise for you he said
# Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeests directly towards Simba
# wildebeests
# didn't it
# didn't we read that they were going to get a wildebeest in the
# right
# that's exciting
# Mufasa took off to save his young son
# but he plunged into the gorge and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests
# he found Simba grabbed him by the nape of his neck and pulled him to a nearby ledge
# suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede
# desperately he tried to cli
# climb another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him
# help me Brother he said
# but Scar let go of Mufasa and he fell down
# it was an accident said Scar I didn't mean for it to happen
# what am I going to do said Simba
# run away Simba said Scar run away and never return
# Scar returned to Pride rock to take over the throne
# meanwhile Simba plodded across the savanna without any food or water
# and it wasn't long before he fainted under the hot sun
# a big hearted wart
# he's so cute can't we keep him
# are you nuts Pumbaa lions eat guys like us said Teemon Timon
# you want some what
# you want another sandwich
# wow I'm impressed Honey
# do you want another
# or do you want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
# you want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
# what kind of sandwich would you like Honey
# you could also have a turkey sandwich or a ham sandwich
# uhhuh
# what do you want
# hummus
# another
# yeah really boy
# another hummus sandwich oh boy
# maybe you wanna read the rest of the Lion king book to yourself Honey
# well I can once I finish making your sandwich
# Honey I'm making your sandwich
# really
# what would you like to eat
# you want some water
# how do you ask nicely
# okay
# yes I can let me just

# &-uh
# here's some water in your little baby cup yeah let me just get the phone
# hello
# hello
# I'm good how's the birthday boy

# that's what
# it occurred to me after I left a message that he wasn't there
# &-um Lily has her Brown thing now actually can I call you back in just a little bit
# okay

# Mommy's eating edges of your hummus sandwich
# because it's so tasty

# I know that's the neatest backpack I've ever seen
# mhm
# Simba stayed in the jungle with Pumbaa and Timon a long long time and grew into a very big lion
# but eventually he got homesick
# and one night he looked up at the stars and recalled the words his father had told him long ago
# the great kings of the past look down on us from those stars so whenever you feel alone just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
# the next day Pumbaa was stalked and chased by a lioness
# Simba came to his rescue but after wrestling with the lioness who easily flipped him on his back he realized she was his old friend Nala
# why didn't you come back to Pride rock she asked you are the king
# I'm not the king Scar is
# Simba he let the hyenas take over the Pride lands there's no food or and no water
# and if you don't do something soon everyone will starve
# you're our only hope
# Simba went to the reflecting pool and when he looked in the water he saw a lion
# the ghost of Mufasa magically appeared
# look inside yourself Simba you are more than what you have become
# you must take your place in the circle of life
# encouraged by his father's words Simba returned to Pride rock
# when he arrived he found the land bare and dry
# the hyenas were in control and Scar was shouting at Simba's mother
# I'm the king said Scar if you were half the king Mufasa was I'm ten times the king Mufasa was
# suddenly a flash of lightning revealed the edge of Pride rock and there stood Simba
# I'm a little surprised to see you alive Simba
# give me one good reason I shouldn't rip you apart Scar
# but Scar forced Simba to say in front of all the lions that he had caused his father's death
# oh Simba you're in trouble again but this time daddy isn't here to save you and everyone knows why
# Simba knowing the truth leapt on Scar
# Nala and the other lionesses joined the battle
# Scar tried to escape
# and Simba ran after him Scar pleaded with his nephew
# run away Scar said Simba and never return
# limping badly Scar
# limping badly Simba climbed to the top of pride rock and let out a magnificent roar as he looked out over his kingdom
# before long Pride rock flourished again Nala remained by Simba's side and soon they had they had their own newborn cub
# and I held him up for all the kingdom to see
# another book which book would you like to read

# Horton hatches the egg
# this is a long one do you wanna read a shorter one
# this one
# you gonna help me read
# sighed Maisy a lazy bird hatching an egg I'm tired and I'm bored and I've kinks in my
# from sitting just sitting here day after day it's work how I hate it I'd much rather
# right
# I'd take a vacation fly off for a rest if I could find someone to stay on my
# if I could find someone I'd fly away free
# then Horton the elephant passed by her
# right
# hello called the lazy bird smiling her best you've nothing to do and I do need a rest
# would you like to sit on the egg in my nest
# the elephant laughed why of all silly things I haven't feathers and I haven't wings
# me on your egg why that doesn't make sense your egg is so small mam and I am so
# immense
# tut tut answered Maisy I know you're not small but I'm sure you can do it no trouble
# just sit on it softly you're gentle and kind come be a good fellow I know you
# I can't said the elephant please begged the bird
# I won't be gone long sir I give you
# I'll hurry right back why I'll never be missed
# very well said the elephant since you
# you want a vacation go fly off and take it I'll sit on your egg and I'll try not to
# I'll stay and be faithful I mean what I say toodleloo sang out Maisy and fluttered
# hm the first thing to do murmured Horton let's see
# the first thing to do is to prop up this
# and make it much stronger that has to be done
# before I get on it I must weigh
# then carefully tenderly gently he crept
# up the trunk to the next where the little egg
# slept
# then Horton the elephant smiled now that's that and he sat and he sat
# he's sitting on it he's keeping it warm
# and he sat all that day and he kept the egg warm and he sat all that night through a
# it poured and it lightning it thundered and rumbled this isn't much fun the poor elephant
# I wish she'd come back cause I'm cold and I'm wet I hope that that Maisy bird doesn't
# but Maisy by this time was far beyond reach enjoying the sunshine way off in
# and having such fun such a wonderful rest decided she'd never
# great
# let me grab the phone ringing
# sure Sweetie
# yes let me get it for you
# let me get you some cold water
# there's your ball
# kay sweets
# so Horton kept sitting there day after day and soon it was autumn the leaves
# and then came the winter the snow and sleet and icicles hung from
# his trunk and his feet but Horton kept sitting and said with a sneeze I'll stay on this egg and I won't let it
# I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
# so poor Horton sat there the whole winter through and then came the spring time with troubles
# his friends gathered round and they shouted with glee look Horton the elephant's up in a
# they taunted and teased him they yelled how absurd old Horton the elephant thinks he's a
# they laughed and they laughed and they all ran away and Horton was lonely he wanted to
# he sat on the egg and he
# there's your water
# I meant what I said and I said what I meant and elephant's faithful
# no matter what happens this egg must be tended
# but poor Horton's troubles were far far from
# so for while Horton sat there so faithful so kind three hunters came sneaking up softly
# behind
# he heard the men's footsteps and turned with a start three rifles were aiming right straight at his
# oh no
# did he run he did not
# Horton stayed on that nest he held his head high and threw out his
# he looked at the hunters as much as to say shoot if you must but I won't
# I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
# but the men didn't shoot much to Horton's surprise they dropped their three guns and they stared with
# look they all shouted can such a thing be an elephant sitting on top of a
# it's strange it's amazing it's wonderful new don't shoot him we'll catch him that's just
# and it's just what we'll do
# we'll take him alive why he's terribly funny we'll sell him back home to a circus for
# oh my gosh
# and the first thing he knew they had built a big wagon with ropes on the front for the pullers to drag on they dug up his tree and put him inside with Horton so sad he practically
# oh no
# up out of the jungle up into the sky up over the mountains ten thousand feet
# and down down the mountains and down to the sea went the cart with the elephant egg nest and
# and out of the wagon and onto a ship out over the ocean and oh
# what a trip
# rolling and tossing and splashed with the spray and Horton sat day after day after day
# I am reading

# just sit on it softly you're gentle and kind
# come be a good fellow I know you won't mind
# I can't said the elephant please begged the bird I won't be gone long sir I give you my word
# I'll hurry right back why I'll never be missed
# very well said the elephant since you
# insist
# you want a vacation go fly off and take it I'll sit on your egg and I'll try not to break it
# I'll stay and be faithful I mean what I say
# toodleloo sang out Maisy and fluttered away
# hm
# first thing to do murmured Horton let's see
# first thing to do is to prop up this tree
# and make it much stronger that has to be done
# before I get on it I must weigh a
# right
# he weighs a
# he must weight a ton
# and that's a lot
# then carefully tenderly gently he crept
# up the trunk to the nest where the little egg
# slept
# and Horton the elephant smiled now that's that
# and he sat and he sat and he sat and he
# and he sat all that day and he kept the egg warm and he sat all that night through a terrible storm
# it poured and it lightninged it thundered and rumbled
# this isn't much fun the poor elephant grumbled
# I wish she'd come back cause I'm cold and I'm wet
# I hope that that Maisy bird doesn't
# right
# but Maisy by this time was far beyond reach
# enjoying the sunshine way off in
# right
# and having such fun such a wonderful rest
# decided she'd never go back to her
# right that's not very nice is it
# no that's why she's a lazy lazy bird
# so Horton kept sitting there day after day and soon it was autumn the leaves blew away
# and then came the winter the snow and sleet
# and icicles hung from his trunk and his
# ah
# you're right
# but Horton kept sitting and said with a sneeze
# I'll stay on this egg and I won't let it
# right
# I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
# one hundred percent
# right
# he's very faithful and he's taking care of that egg
# right
# make sure it's okay
# so poor Horton sat there the whole winter through
# and then came the spring time with troubles anew
# his friends gathered round and shouted with glee
# look Horton the elephant's up in a tree
# they taunted and teased and they yelled how absurd
# old Horton the elephant thinks he's a
# right
# they laughed and they laughed then they all ran away
# and Horton was lonely he wanted to play
# he did wanna play
# well I think they're going to go play but Horton's got_to take care of his little egg right
# great
# he's got responsibilities
# I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful one hundred percent
# no matter what happens this egg must be tended
# but poor Horton's troubles were far far from ended
# for while Horton sat there so faithful so kind
# three hunters came sneaking up softly behind
# he heard the men's steps and turned with a start
# three rifles were aiming right straight at his heart
# did he run
# he did not
# he stayed on that nest
# he held his head high and threw out his chest
# he looked at the hunters as much as to say
# shoot if you must but I won't
# right
# I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
# right
# hm
# mhm
# that's right
# sat all that day
# but the men didn't shoot much to Horton's surprise they dropped their three guns and they stared with wide eyes
# look they all shouted can such a thing be
# an elephant sitting on top of a tree
# it's strange it's amazing it's wonderful new
# don't shoot him we'll catch him that's just what we'll do
# let's take him alive why he's terrible funny
# we'll sell him back home to a circus
# right
# no that wasn't very nice
# and the first thing he knew they had built a big wagon with ropes on the front for the pullers to drag on
# no they're not so nice
# they dug up his tree and put it inside with Horton so sad
# no those hunters are not so nice
# well this little animal's nice
# right and Horton's nice
# yeah
# but Horton so sad he practically
# right
# no
# we're off the men shouted and off they all went with Horton unhappy
# one hundred percent
# oh no
# up out of the jungle up into the sky up over the mountains ten thousand feet high
# and down down the mountains and down to the sea went the cart with the elephant
# right
# then out of the wagon and onto a ship out over the ocean and oh
# what a trip
# no he doesn't feel so well
# rolling and tossing and splash with a spray
# no
# and Horton said day after day after day I meant what I said and I said what I meant but oh am I
# oh poor Horton
# after bobbing around for two weeks like a cork they landed at last in the town of
# New_York who lives in New_York
# that's one of the hunters
# &-um one of them's right here
# he's probably still on the boat
# I think
# who lives in New_York Honey
# exactly
# all ashore the men shouted and down with a lurch
# when eleph
# Horton the elephant still on his perch
# tied onto a board that could just scarcely hold him
# bop
# Horton landed and then
# then sold him
# sold to a circus then week after week they showed him to people at ten cents a peek
# they took him to
# Boston
# Daddy works in Boston doesn't he
# yeah how does he get from Boston
# whoa careful oh my gosh careful Sweetie
# watch out for your granola bites
# got a little smushed
# they took him to Boston to Kalamazoo Chicago Weehawken and Washington too
# to Dayton Ohio
# careful Sweets oh my gosh
# to Dayton Ohio Saint_Paul Minnesota Wichita Kansas and Drake
# north Dakota
# and everywhere thousands of folks flocked to see and laugh at the elephant up in a tree
# poor Horton grew sadder the farther he went
# but he said as he sat in that hot noisy tent
# I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful one hundred percent
# then one day
# the circus show happened to reach a town way down south not so far from
# right
# is that nice
# sure
# and dawdling a long way up high in the sky who of all people should chance to fly by but that old good for nothing bird runaway Maisy
# still on vacation and still just as
# right
# no Maisy is not very nice
# and spying the flags on the tents just below she
# I hope she's gonna be nice again
# she swooped from the clouds through an open tent door good gracious gasped Maisy I've seen you before
# poor Horton looked up with his face white as chalk
# he started to speak but before he could talk
# there rang out the noisiest ear
# a thumping a bumping a scratching my egg shouted Horton my egg why it's hatching
# but it's mine screamed the bird when she heard the egg crack
# the work was all done now she wanted it back
# it's my egg she sputtered you stole it from me get off of my nest and get out of my tree
# not a nice bird
# now
# poor Horton backed down with a sad heavy heart
# but at that very instant the egg burst apart
# and out of the pieces of red and white shell from the egg that he'd sat on so long and so well
# Horton the elephant saw something whiz
# it had ears
# just like
# and the people came shouting what's all this about and they looked and they stared with their eyes popping out
# and they cheered and they cheered and they cheered more and more
# they'd never seen anything like it before
# my_goodness my gracious they shouted my word
# it's something quite new it's an
# an elephant bird
# no she's not so nice that Maisy
# and it should be it should be it should be like that because Horton was faithful he sat and he sat he meant what he said and he said what he meant and they sent him home
# happy
# one hundred percent

# fall leaves
# okay well Honey I start reading and then you don't like that page maybe oh
# mushroom hunt
# early fall is the best time to go I didn't know this Honey
# early fall is the best time to go hunting for toadstools and mushrooms
# we should tell Daddy that
# you can find an astonishing variety in fields and forests and even in gardens
# toadstools and mushrooms are fungi
# these are plants that don't have any leaves or flowers but send tiny threads down into other plants or animal &-uh other plants or animal dung and feed on them
# some fungi grow on dead leaves and others grow on tree trunks or dead logs
# here are some to look for
# cepes
# also known as the porcini I believe
# has a dark brown cap with pores underneath instead of gills
# ooh this is a poisonous one we are not allowed to eat that one
# let's see which ones look like the ones that we see
# look at that giant puff ball
# it's a giant puff ball mushroom
# that's very funny
# Dryad's_Saddle has a pale yellow brown cap with darker scales
# and a crimson wax cap is red
# that's right that's a honey fungus mushroom
# yeah ooh this mushroom is called a stink horn and it has a nasty strong smell P U
# yeah
# yeah you could
# yeah
# yeah look at those and these are called Chanterelle mushrooms
# mm this is called a parasol
# cause it looks like an umbrella
# Sweetie can you eat some of your
# cinnamon toast
# look this is all about spiders Honey
# uhhuh
# is that tasty
# uhhuh
# the best time to see spiders' webs is early on a fall morning when their fragile threads are strung with beads of dew or mist
# spiders spin webs to catch insects
# different spiders have different types of webs
# hm
# they don't look so nice you don't think
# they do
# do the spiders look very nice
# pretty nice
# how small
# yeah
# that spider's trying to eat that bug
# don't ya think
# how spiders spin sheet webs in the corners of rooms
# you're right
# you are right
# &-uh
# does that look like a mushroom that might be a spider hiding
# planting
# mhm
# many spring flowers grow from bulbs but you have_to plant them in the fall eight to twelve weeks beforehand
# you can plant them in a garden or in pots
# you can also plant them in indoor pots as long as you keep them in a cool dark place for two to three months
# indoor bulbs flower earlier than outdoor ones because it is warmer inside
# hm pretty
# &-uh chocolate cobweb cake
# make this delicious cake for a fall party or celebration
# it is very easy
# yeah a little spider
# all of the ingredients are mixed together in the same bowl
# that looks good doesn't it
# mhm
# yummy
# you know what that is
# chocolate right
# that is a chocolate cake
# yummy
# yummy
# as the days grow shorter and colder in the fall some birds and animals leave their summer homes and travel great distances to spend the win
# oh a butterfly how pretty that's called a monarch butterfly
# look at that funny bird
# oh that's a swallow
# that little bird
# and this is a hoopoe apparently
# well &-uh some birds and animals leave their summer homes and travel great distances to spend the winter in warmer lands where there's plenty of food this is called migration
# that means when it gets cold out Honey the birds fly south to the warm weather that's called migration
# neat huh
# mhm
# preparing for winter
# in the fall wherever you live you may find signs of birds and animals getting ready for the winter
# many of them stock up on food before it becomes scarce and others are preparing shelters or homes to keep them warm and safe for the winter
# squirrels bury nuts in the fall
# any nuts that a squirrel forgets about may sprout and grow into trees
# oh look at that
# I'm not sure what kind of butterfly it is but it's pretty huh
# yeah
# there's the stars at night
# these star maps will help you identify the constellations that you can see in the night sky in the winter
# the best time to use the maps is at around eleven P M on a clear night away from city lights
# you know Mommy and Daddy grew up in the city and we never saw any stars because there were so many lights in the city
# but the stars look pretty here
# and one day when you were a little tiny baby Mommy and Daddy got you up in the middle of the night and took you out to &-uh a play
# I think there were some shooting stars or something like that
# but we bundled you up and you were nice and warm
# yes I can
# hello
# winter weather
# in most parts of the winter winter is colder than other seasons
# the days are shorter and the nights are longer
# in countries where the temperature drops below freezing point for much of the winter there is a lot of frost and snow
# and some places there may be snow on the ground for several months
# hm
# this is neat this says how to make a snow shaker
# yeah that's very neat
# stormy skies
# water colors are very good for painting moody skies and clouds
# especially if you wet the paper first
# before you start a picture try some of the ideas shown below to find out how to create different effects
# wow
# look at this you can make clouds
# oh how pretty
# ooh and there's a castle
# and stormy stormy air
# winter buds
# in the winter trees hardly grow at all but slow down and rest
# oh
# I think it's a tree actually with a little bud
# see
# is that neat
# all the look at all these different little sticks with things growing on them huh
# let's see if we can find our tree in the back
# our tree's a red oak tree
# I don't see any oaks here
# here's a turkey oak maybe that's sort of
# sort of like ours
# yeah
# let's see
# that's right
# look at all those beautiful green leaves
# that's an oak leaf
# that's kinda like what falls from our tree
# this one
# that's kinda brown and then these are green right
# winter trees
# trees that lose their leaves in winter are called deciduous trees
# well you learn something every day huh
# almost all of them have broad flat leaves
# deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and grow new ones in the following spring
# do all the leaves fall to the ground and we rake them up into big piles
# or Manny rakes them up for us cause he's better at it than we are
# winter flowers oh look at all
# few plants flower in the winter because frost and ice harm them but toward the end of the winter when it starts to get warmer the first flowers appeal
# look for them in sheltered spots in gardens parks and woodlands
# the crocus sometimes we see little crocus flowers here
# when winter is over
# camellias those are pretty huh
# they do look like roses they do
# baked potatoes
# yummy
# oh those are tomatoes you're right those are tomatoes and these are potatoes
# baked potatoes are one of the easiest things to cook and make a warming meal on a winter's day
# below are
# they're potatoes
# do they look like little rocks
# they do
# okay this does not sound good to Mommy
# below are two suggestions for different fillings
# tuna and sweet corn
# does that sound good to you tuna and corn in a potato
# really it doesn't sound so good to Mommy
# but you know maybe it's good but
# it kind of looks like someone threw up
# but don't let me hold you back
# cheese and bacon ooh doesn't that sound good cheese and bacon on a potato
# who likes bacon
# that sounds good to me does it sound good to you
# cheese and bacon you like bacon don't you
# so this is how you bake
# make a baked potato Sweetie
# you wash your potato
# and you poke it with a fork
# and you put it in a hot oven
# and then it gets all cooked and you cut it open and you can fill it with things
# yummy
# that's right
# that's right
# bird watching
# it is hard for birds to find enough to eat in the winter so you can help them by putting out food and water for them in your yard or on a window ledge
# this gives a good opportunity to watch them at close hand
# know what we should proly do Honey
# I think on our tree back there we have a bird feeder but it doesn't have any bird food in it do you think maybe this weekend we should buy some
# and then we could see some really neat birds
# maybe we could see a blue jay
# or a cardinal
# that would be neat
# hm
# oh look it says here we can put bread or cheese or potato or bacon
# birds like bacon too
# everybody likes bacon
# cept for maybe a pig
# surviving the winter
# different animals have different ways of coping with the cold weather and lack of food in winter
# some of them go to sleep all winter that's called hibernation
# others have thick coats to keep them warm so they can continue looking for food throughout the winter
# that's a little sleeping hedgehog
# this is a marmot
# it's a alpine marmot
# alpine marmots seal themselves into their burrows underground and sleep for the winter
# that is they sleep for half the year
# six months
# well that's right caterpillars will turn into butterflies right
# bugs that's right sometimes they shed their skin
# let's see what it says about summer and spring okay
# &

# would you like to take your Cinderella wig off Sweetie
# no
# looks pretty snazzy
# planting seeds did we plant
# we planted some things in the backyard didn't we
# plant flower seeds indoors early in spring and they will flower in the summer
# here you can see how to grow pansies from seeds but you can plant most other small flower seeds in the same way
# you fill the little containers with soil
# and you put two little seeds in each section
# cover the box with newspaper and leave it outside
# water every few days
# that's interesting
# I did not know that
# after two weeks shoots will appear
# that is very very interesting
# hm
# how bout that
# soak the egg box wow you can plant them in the little egg box
# I did not even know that
# and put them in a big pot

# frogs lay their eggs in
# and those are newts
# wanna hear about frogs how frogs grow
# frogs lay their eggs in clumps of clear jelly which float to the surface of the pond
# after about ten days
# yeah that's kind of a little weird
# after about ten days tadpoles wiggle out
# that's what they look like it kind of looks
# sort of looks like a frog but sort of looks like a fish
# and they swim in search of food
# the tadpoles then grow legs
# and they come to the surface of the water to breathe
# after twelve or thirteen weeks the tadpoles have turned into tiny frogs
# wow that's neat
# oh look at all these eggs that you can decorate look how pretty these are
# that's right did you go did you go on an egg hunt last year
# who'd

# spring is a good
# that's a caterpillar
# spring is a
# mhm
# caterpillar caterpillar
# spring is a good time to look for caterpillars you might spot some in a garden or out in the country
# many of them live on leaves but you may also find one wiggling across a path in search of its food plant
# wow
# he is looking at you
# the tiny caterpillar eats and eats and grows bigger and bigger
# and then it makes a hard case called a pupa around itself
# or a cocoon
# and when it comes out
# well this is the little cocoon they make around themselves and when they come out of the cocoon what are they
# ah a big butterfly or a moth
# hm
# well this is a butterfly but a caterpillar can also turn into a moth
# a moth is a moth

# maybe we should do that next year
# yes tomatoes are red so delicious
# yeah delicious
# mm strawberries
# that's yummy
# hm summer flowers oh that's very pretty
# &-uh bug watch
# what are those
# beetles have hardened front wings that protect their delicate flying wings
# look for them under bark
# &-um that's another type that's called a devil's coach horse beetle
# and this is a green shield beetle
# and this is a click beetle
# that apparently is a cockchafer beetle
# yeah and what's this
# that's a dragonfly right
# right
# wow you're right
# &-um beetles eat all kinds of plants and animals and there are thousands of different beetles living everywhere
# ants live together in enormous groups called colonies and they make nests by burrowing in sand or soil
# if you watch where a line of ants goes you will probably find their nest hole
# the ants work hard carrying food and other things back to the colony
# they leave a scent trail between the food they find and the nest so the rest of the ants will know which way they went
# bees there's a little bumble
# bees feed on nectar a sweet liquid found inside most flowers
# most bees gather nectar from one type of flower at a time
# as a bee flies from flower to flower it also gathers pollen
# the sticky yellow dust inside flowers
# it carries the pollen to other flowers and this helps the flowers to make new seeds
# that's great
# okay you hold the bug page open Honey
# okay
# when I come back are you gonna tell me something great about bugs
# you know what we may Sweetie what we may do later
# we may hafta stop at the mall okay
# we don't need to get beetles at the mall but we hafta get you socks you need socks at the mall
# you want me to hold that you get comfy
# did you learn anything exciting about bugs while I was gone
# what did you learn
# did you find did you learn that let's see
# dragonflies fly
# those are ants
# dragonflies fly low above ponds and streams early in the summer
# their brightly colored bodies flash as they swoop across the water chasing insects
# you may see them resting on leaves their wings outstretched in the sun
# butterflies and moths are attracted to brightly colored scented flowers
# like bees they feed on nectar
# watch how they stretch
# yeah there's a butterfly
# hm
# interesting
# okay &-uh snail trail
# snails live in damp shady places and are easy to find
# that's a snail

# oh the slime the slime
# well
# it's a little yucky but it's neat too
# yeah
# well you could touch some that's true I guess
# snails usually come out to feed at night or after rain
# this is because their skin is not waterproof
# and they die if they dry out
# oh look that's interesting
# that's a snail he's on top of a banana
# that's the snail
# an that's his shell
# in the winter or hot weather snails hide in shady spots they close themselves into their shells with slime
# most snails feed on plants and are especially fond of soft growing shoots
# interesting very interesting
# if you go to a beach you can have fun looking for shells pebbles and other treasures
# it's best to explore at low tide when the sea is out
# try looking along the line of seaweed that marks the high water level
# at the top of the beach

# most plant foods are grown as crops and are picked or harvested in the summer
# grain crops
# look for combine harvesters working in the fields late in the summer
# these huge machines harvest crops such as wheat oats rye and barley
# that are grown for their seeds or grain
# combine harvesters don't just cut they crop they also gather it together and separate the grain from the stalk
# the grain is ground into flour or used to make bread or breakfast cereal

# colors in a rainbow are always in the same order
# red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet

# right
# yeah that spider not so nice
# the sly spider laughed as he gobbled his snack a bear is a mother who's yellow and black

# Jasmine held back her tears as her father left the palace garden
# oh Raja she said to her pet tiger what ever will I do
# she looked up at the high walls surrounding the palace
# if she could just climb over that wall she'd be free

# of course I didn't go so I had them to submit already thankfully
# oh this one that's what a friend is
# yeah there's nothing to make you feel stupid like a standardized test
# I'm like every time I've ever taken like my S A Ts my G R Es everything I'm like I'm an English major and my math always ends up higher than my English which is not to say my math is astronomically high but I'm like what happened
# I know and I think they changed the format now actually cause when I took it
# okay I just wanna tell Amanda one quick thing
# it used to be math verbal and analytical but I think it's different now isn't it
# &-uh jeez
# and who judges that you know like
# oh
# jeez
# a friend is a listener who will always be there when you've got a big secret you just hafta share
# a friend is a sidekick who'll sit by your side to make you feel better when you're troubled inside
# and when there's nothing to do on a wet rainy day a friend is a pal who'll come over to play
# friends are just perfect for all kinds of things
# like walking or talking or swinging on swings
# and for watching tv a friend is the best
# for cheering cartoons with and booing the rest
# and then late at night a friend is just right
# for telling ghost stories when you've turned off the light
# yes a friend is the best one to hop skip or run with
# for playing some catch or just having fun with
# they're running aren't they
# yeah
# you can sing and shout til your tonsils wear out
# cause that's what having a friend's all about
# a friend is a buddy who'll come to your aid
# when he thinks you need help or you might be afraid
# a friend is a partner who'll stand back to back
# to protect you from bullies or a monster attack
# with a friend you can do what you most like to do
# you can have your own hideouts in dark secret places
# or spend the whole day having caterpillar races
# what's that
# can I see
# looks like it came out of a puzzle or something
# little pink circle
# whoopsie sorry
# a little pink circle
# you can laugh you can cry you can watch cars go by
# oh I missed a page
# sorry or just drawing pictures of each other's faces
# you can laugh you can cry you can watch cars go by
# you can have a great time and not even try
# a friend is a person who likes to be there
# cause you two make a wonderful pair
# and when all's said and done a natural end is
# a friend is a friend that's what a friend is
# who are your friends
# you have lots_of friends

# wow
# oh oh

# okay
# who's that
# Cinderella
# every day Cinderella woke up early to do chores for her stepmother and stepsisters
# from morning to night she they gave her things to do
# but the birds and mice were Cinderella's friends and helped her with her work
# one morning a messenger came from the palace to invite Cinderella and her stepsisters to a royal ball
# oh a little bird wearing a pink hat
# wow
# yellow hat
# and a green hat too
# Cinderella was very excited but her stepmother gave her a long list of chores to do before she could go
# while Cinderella was busy working the birds and mice began fixing an old dress that had belonged to Cinderella's mother
# before long they made Cinderella a beautiful gown
# by the time Cinderella finished her chores she thought it was too late to get ready for the ball
# and was very sad
# surprise the birds and mice gave Cinderella the finished gown
# oh thank you so much she said
# Cinderella got dressed and rushed to join her stepsisters but when they saw her they became so jealous they tore her lovely gown to pieces
# oh no they tore her gown
# that wasn't very nice
# Cinderella ran to the garden and wept
# just then sparkling lights swirled all around
# it was her
# who was it
# who is that
# it's her fairy godmother
# dry those tears she said you can't go to the ball looking like that
# with a wave of her magic wand the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and Cinderella's rags into a gorgeous gown
# and with one more wave Cinderella had tiny glass slippers on her feet
# before Cinderella left for the ball she received a warning
# on the stroke of midnight the spell will be broken and everything will be as before
# that night at the ball the prince met Cinderella and without knowing each other's names they danced and danced until the clock struck midnight
# I must go Cinderella cried
# and as she fled she lost a
# a glass slipper on the staircase
# the next day the prince announced he wanted to marry the girl who had lost her glass slipper
# when the wicked stepmother realized it was Cinderella who was the prince's favorite she locked Cinderella in her room
# let me out Cinderella cried
# the grand duke went to every home in the kingdom looking for the maiden whose foot fit the tiny glass shoe
# Cinderella's little friends took the key out of the stepmother's pocket and slipped it under Cinderella's door just in time
# when the grand duke put the slipper on Cinderella's foot
# it fit perfectly
# soon after Cinderella and the prince were married and they lived happily ever after
# that one oh look who that is
# that's Snow white
# oh yes
# long ago there lived a lovely princess named Snow white
# oh she's wearing a blue bow in her hair
# Snow white's stepmother the queen was jealous of Snow white's beauty
# each day the queen would ask magic mirror on the wall who's the fairest one of all
# and the mirror would always answer you are
# one day the mirror said a lovely maid I see who is more fair than thee
# the queen knew it must be Snow white
# Snow white was so beautiful and kind that even a handsome prince who was passing by soon noticed her
# little did he know that when he came into the courtyard to sing to Snow white the evil queen was watching nearby
# the queen was very jealous
# ooh now she's wearing a red bow you're right
# Snow white realized she must leave home or risk being hurt by the queen
# Snow white was so frightened that she ran deep into the forest
# do you know where I can stay she asked a group of friendly animals
# what kind of animals are there
# some bunny rabbits and
# a turtle
# that's right and you know what this is
# a raccoon and you know what these are
# those are little deer
# and that's a little chipmunk
# right
# chipmunks
# and a squirrel and oh
# mushrooms wow
# look it looks like a reindeer that's right
# oh it is a reindeer okay
# I think it might be yes
# yes I think so
# I think you're right
# the animals led Snow white to a tiny cottage in the woods
# it's like a doll's house she said
# she knocked on the door but no one answered
# so she slowly stepped inside
# Snow white found seven tiny bowls seven tiny chairs and seven tiny beds
# but the cottage was a mess
# oh my there must be seven tiny children living here
# let's clean the house and surprise them she said to the animals
# and then maybe they'll let me stay
# soon seven tiny men arrived the seven dwarves
# Snow white promised to wash and sew and sweep for the little men
# in return they kept her safe and happy
# the seven dwarfs loved having Snow white stay in their cottage
# back at the castle the magic mirror told the queen where Snow white was hiding
# the queen was so angry that she drank a potion and turned herself into an old hag
# and then she created a magic apple
# with one bite of this poisoned apple Snow white's eyes will close forever
# the only cure for the sleeping spell was love's first kiss
# as soon as the dwarves went to work the queen disguised as a peddler woman approached Snow white
# the forest animals recognized the queen and ran off to warn the dwarves
# but by the time the dwarves arrived it was too late
# Snow white had already taken a bite of the poisoned apple and
# she took a bite of that apple and she fell asleep
# oh my
# the evil queen fled from the cottage but the seven dwarves raced after her and chased her to a rocky cliff
# well the the seven dwarves are angry at the witch because she's not very nice to Snow white
# well the seven dwarves are nice they're just angry
# a rock broke beneath her feet and the queen fell from the mountaintop into the darkness below

# when Puddle came into the kitchen for breakfast there was a note on the table
# dear Puds gone for a walk be back soon Toot
# P S I'll cut the grass when I get back
# hm
# Puddle cut the grass
# at lunch time there was still no sign of Toot
# maybe he went fishing said Tulip the bird
# but we always go fishing together answered Puddle
# where is Toot that's the question
# dinner time came and Toot still wasn't back
# he never misses dinner Puddle says
# ooh this is delicious said Tulip Toot would love it
# Toot Puddle called into the woods
# is he lost asked Tulip
# you can't get lost in your own woods said Puddle
# when it grew dark Puddle really began to worry
# what if Toot tumbled into a hole and couldn't get out
# or worse Puddle thought something even worse
# what do those look like
# puppies maybe they're wolves
# I think so
# I'd better go search for him Puddle decided he's my best friend
# Puddle walked all through the woods and around Pocket Pond and climbed to the top of Orchard Hill searching for his friend
# Toot he called where are you
# aha what do we have here
# footprints
# Puddle tramped through the dark woods until
# the starry sky opened before him
# oh Toot loves trains thought Puddle
# wha do you see
# a train do you think Toot
# a caboose all the way in the back
# do you think that Toot got on the train
# I think so too
# so Puddle jumped on the train too
# chuga choo choo
# airport Puddle said
# just the other day Toot was saying he hadn't flown anywhere in months
# Provence mused Puddle
# France
# that was one place Toot had never been
# I guess he hadn't been to Provence is the country in France but Toot went to Paris in France in the last book didn't he
# member and he loved art he saw the Mona Lisa in Paris
# yeah
# do what am I doing Puddle asked himself now Tulip would be worried about him too
# but his thought came too late
# which way would I go Puddle thought if I were Toot
# ah Provence was beautiful
# but where was his friend
# bonjour mon ami Toot cheered
# Toot cried Puddle what are you doing here
# I guess I got carried away Toot said I hopped on a train and then a bus and then a plane and then a bicycle and then one thing led to another all the way to Kookooposh
# I had a whim
# how in the world did you get here
# the same way said Puddle I went looking for you and one thing just led to another all the way here
# that's just how whims are said Toot
# isn't it exciting to be in such a far away place Toot asked
# Tulip will be worried now that we're both missing said Puddle
# there's Toot with his little
# yep there's Toot
# and there's Puddle
# he's talking to the man who works for the &-uh airport
# Tulip will be worried now that we're both mithing  missing said Puddle I'd better give her a jingle
# I found him Puddle said we're fine we'll be back soon
# &-uh what's Toot looking at
# picture of a
# very tall mountain in Nepal
# they have the highest mountain in the world there Toot said
# are you sure this is a good idea asked Puddle
# oh I'm sure and they got back on an airplane
# phew puffed Puddle that was fun he said when they got_to the top of the mountain
# I'll say said Toot
# I'm glad we did it together said Puddle
# as they hiked down the mountain Puddle was quiet
# what's wrong Toot asked are you getting pooped out
# I think I'm getting homesick Puddle admitted
# that happens to me every time Toot told him I love to go off on a trip and then when the time comes I love to go back home
# and there they are back at home
# sitting in the
# hammock right
# shou we read your solar system book
# okay
# right
# it's called our solar system
# wow
# right our solar system
# our solar system is made up of a star which we call the Sun
# and a group of smaller objects that travel around it
# these include the planets one of which is Earth where we li
# what
# &
# Jupiter there's Jupiter
# wow
# that is that's right that's Jupiter
# do you remember what this one is called
# Saturn
# this one is Earth where we live
# this one is Uranus
# and this one is
# right
# and Neptune
# and this little one is Pluto
# wow
# that's neat
# well there's &-um Mars
# and Venus and Mercury
# but we're gonna learn about all those okay
# okay
# these include the planets one of which is Earth where we live
# their moons plus asteroids and comets
# the solar system was once a cloud of dust and gas that stretched for more than a trillion miles
# that's very big
# about five billion years ago a nearby star exploded sending shockwaves through the cloud
# the c the cloud became a slow turning disk and the disk's center shrank and became the Sun
# other particles from the cloud stuck together and formed planets which travel in roughly circular orbits around the Sun
# planets near the Sun are small and rocky
# and those are that are f
# those farther away are larger and made mostly of gas
# here's the Sun
# wow the Sun is more than a million times larger than the Earth
# it's a huge ball of hydrogen and helium gases
# wow that's pretty neat
# Merc you wanna learn about the planets
# okay
# Mercury is a small rocky planet
# it's right here
# it is closer to the Sun than any other planet and travels around the Sun
# Pluto
# Pluto that's right
# it's closer to the Sun than any other planet and travels around the Sun in only eighty eight Earth days
# Mercury's surface is filled with craters made by space rocks that crashed on to its surface
# whoa
# I love you
# the planet has a very thin atmosphere and temperatures can rise
# Jupiter
# can rise to more than eight hundred degrees
# that's Mercury
# yeah
# yeah
# the Sun
# but it can be hundreds of degrees below zero during the long nights
# wow
# neat
# Venus
# there's Venus
# right
# Venus is about the same size as the Earth but would not be pleasant to visit
# that is our
# that's the Moon
# the Moon
# the Moon
# wow
# the very tiny Moon
# this is interesting Honey
# well that's our big Moon
# it just looks tiny in the picture next to the planet
# yeah
# the atmosphere is so dense on Venus you would feel like you were under water
# hm
# wow
# thick red clouds hold in the terrible heat
# if you were on Venus you would feel like you were under water
# wow
# as far as we know Earth is the only planet that has life
# that's Earth where we live
# wow
# on Earth
# on Earth
# Earth's
# hm I don't think anybody lives on Jupiter
# cause it's very very cold out there
# Gabby lives on Earth too look the Moon
# see
# wow the Moon is Earth's satellite
# there's Earth
# that's right
# wow
# wow that is so neat
# in nineteen sixty nine human astronauts landed on the Moon's surface for the first time
# the astronauts could see the Earth shining in Moon in the Moon's black daytime sky
# because the Moon's atmosphere is very thin its sky remains black even when the sun shines
# hm Mars
# Mars has long been called the Red Planet
# wow
# Tamar lives on Earth
# we all live on Earth
# it's true wow
# Mars
# right
# millions of years ago the atmosphere was thicker and warmer rain fell and rivers flowed
# space probes have sent photographs of the dry riverbeds and some water may still be frozen in the soil
# wow
# on Mars the temperature may reach eighty degrees at the equator on a summer day but at night it is colder than anywhere on Earth
# scientists hope to visit Mars in the early two thousands
# that would be so neat
# that's a picture of Ear
# of Mars
# I think that is the neatest thing
# right it's a whole other planet and we have pictures of it
# this is a little car that drove on the surface of Mars
# it's called Sojourner
# right
# Sojourner yep
# oh the asteroid belt look at that see all these little tiny rocks
# yeah
# the asteroid belt is located between Mars and Jupiter
# yeah
# belt
# belt an asteroid belt
# wow
# that's neat
# ooh when asteroids come too near Earth they usually burn up
# sometimes a fragment does reach the ground leaving a large crater
# look at that a little asteroid hit the Earth and made this huge crater
# that is so neat
# right
# look what planet are we on
# Jupiter
# I mean we're not literally on it we're just reading about it
# Jupiter is very different from the planets near the Sun
# we we live on Earth
# we're reading about Jupiter now
# we're on the Jupiter page
# Jupiter is very different from the other planets near the Sun
# it's much larger it's eleven times the size of Earth
# and has thirteen hundred times the volume
# but Jupiter is also much less dense
# the asteroid hit
# right you're right
# Jupiter makes one rotation every ten hours
# winds at the equator travel at more than three hundred miles an hour
# one huge hurricane like disturbance
# called the great red spot
# is very very large
# it's a storm that has been raging for at least three hundred years
# we're not having cookies now Honey
# Jupiter has moons too look at this
# hi look at this moon it's called Io
# hello what are you doin
# baby ghost
# baby ghost did you see this moon of Jupiter's
# t's called Io
# and this is called Europa
# Callisto
# and Ganymede
# that's Europa
# Io
# Callisto
# and Ganymede
# those are all moons that travel around Jupiter
# neat huh
# and here's Saturn
# wow
# yeah here's Uranus and Neptune
# right
# that's right did you know
# see these rings around Saturn Honey
# they're made up of particles of ice
# isn't that neat
# here's Uranus
# wow
# to telescopes on Earth Uranus looks like a small green disk without any surface features
# it is twenty times farther away from the Sun than Earth and it spins on its side
# it is a gas giant like Saturn
# but beneath its deep atmosphere is a giant ocean of liquid or icy water
# deep under the ocean there may still be a rocky center
# and here's Neptune
# it's a hazy blue planet
# that's Uranus
# and that's Neptune with these kinda stripes on it
# wow
# has rings right
# and look Triton
# that's Triton
# let's see what Triton is
# hm it's Neptune's largest moon Triton
# and there's little Pluto
# yeah it's dark every day on Pluto
# yeah every day is a dark day on Pluto because the Sun is so far away
# it can only be seen with a powerful telescope because it is both the most distant planet in our solar system and the smallest planet
# wow

# I think you might be right
# okay
# &-uh there are the goblins trying to get to the valley to steal the rainbow
# did we see a rainbow while we were driving
# oh boy let's see if they catch it
# the sun had almost set by the time they reached their goal
# you think so
# wow
# oh in the sky
# they're gonna try and catch it but I don't think so I think that you can't catch a rainbow
# well that's a good thing cause if they caught the rainbow no one would be able to see the rainbow and wouldn't we all be sad
# we don't want the goblins to steal the rainbow right
# no
# we'll spend the night here in the cave the yellow goblin commanded
# when the moon rose and saw them warming themselves around the fire they had lit it shouted out an alarm
# the rainbow goblins are in the valley
# the trees and the bushes took up the cry and the flowers and the grasses and the animals and the waters passed it on and by midnight the evil tidings had spread throughout the valley
# look at the big beautiful moon
# the goblins could hardly contain their excitement
# soon all the colors of the rainbow will be ours Yellow gloated
# we'll snatch it as it rises when the colors are still fresh and creamy
# the blue goblin cackled look at the roots dangling from the walls they're straining to hear our plans
# a lot of good it will do them or their friend the rainbow
# finally exhausted by their scheming the goblins fell asleep
# outside the moon shone on the mirror like surface of the water and its magical light was reflected in the cave
# then all seven goblins had a wonderful dream
# mhm
# mhm
# wow
# yeah I know I don't see orange in this picture but I bet it's in there somewhere
# right doncha think
# yeah
# there's orange
# there he is
# mm I think it must be here in here
# it's just hard to see
# the goblins had a wonderful dream about the paradise of rainbow land where all you had to do was lie on your back and open your mouth
# and yellow
# and the most succulent colors dripped down your throat
# the dream went on and on and the greedy goblins drank and drank and at dawn just as their bellies were about to burst they were awakened by a distant clap of thunder
# &
# the goblins sprang to their feet and rushed to the mouth of the cave
# a storm a storm Red shouted
# look how the wind is driving it towards us Orange cried
# and all the goblins danced and pranced about in glee

# yes
# when Puddle came into the kitchen for breakfast there was a note on the table
# dear Puds gone for a walk be back soon Toot
# P_S I'll cut the grass when I get back
# Puddle cut the grass
# at lunch
# maybe he went fishing Tulip suggested
# but we always go fishing together answered Puddle
# dinnertime came and Toot still wasn't back
# he never misses dinner Puddle said
# oh this is delicious said Tulip Toot would love it
# Toot Puddle called into the woods
# is he lost asked Tulip
# you can't get lost in your own woods said Puddle
# when it grew dark Puddle really began to worry
# what if Toot tumbled into a hole and couldn't get out
# well Pudd Puddle's imagining that Toot is stuck in a hole
# that's Toot
# but he's not really in a hole Puddle's just thinking about it
# mhm
# or worse Puddle thought something much worse
# what do you see
# wolves oh my gosh
# I better go search for him Puddle decided
# he's my best friend
# Puddle walked all through the woods and around Pocket pond and he climbed to the top of Orchard hill searching for his friend
# Toot he called
# where are you
# ah hah what do we have here
# footprints
# whose do you think they are
# wow maybe Toot's
# yeah
# Puddle tramped through dark woods until a starry sky opened before him
# and what did he see
# a train
# Toot loves trains he thought
# so he jumped on
# airport Puddle said
# just the other day Toot was saying he hadn't flown anywhere in months
# oh Provence mused Puddle now that was one place Toot had never been
# what am I doing Puddle asked himself
# now Tulip would be worried about him too
# ah ah yes Provence was beautiful but where was his friend
# bonjour mon ami Toot cheered
# Toot cried Puddle what are you doing here
# I guess I got carried away Toot said
# I hopped on a train and then a bus and then a plane and then a bicycle and one led one thing led to another all the way to Coco_Poche
# I had a whim Toot exclaimed how in the world did you get here
# the same way Puddle said I went looking for you and one thing just led to another all the way here
# that's how whims are said Toot
# isn't it exciting to be in such a faraway place Toot asked
# Tulip will be worried that we're both missing said Puddle I'd better give her a jingle
# I found him Puddle said we're fine we'll be back soon
# what does Toot see
# a mountain
# do you know where that mountain is
# where
# it's in Nepal
# they have the highest mountain in the world in Nepal said Toot
# are you sure this is a good idea asked Puddle
# I'm sure said Toot
# and they caught another plane
# whew puffed Puddle that was fun when they climbed to the top of the mountain
# I'll say said Toot
# I'm glad we did it together said Puddle
# as they hiked down the mountain Puddle was quiet
# what's wrong Toot asked are you getting pooped out
# I think I'm getting homesick admitted Puddle
# that happens to me every time said Toot I love to go off on a trip and when the time comes I love to go back home
# and that's just what they did
# and where are they sitting
# in a hammock

# okay what's this book called
# Franklin
# rides a bike
# Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run
# he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swing
# but Franklin had a problem he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels
# in the Spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes
# Beaver was the brave one she took her extra wheels off first
# she practiced and practiced then she went to the park to show off
# look at me she shouted I can ride my bike all by myself
# Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles
# it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other
# soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels
# we're going on a picnic said Bear come on
# Franklin was worried his friends would make fun of his training wheels so he fibbed and said I'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone
# &
# yeah
# what's wearing
# a helmet and
# a backpack right
# right
# that's so that if they fall down they don't hurt their heads right
# just like when you go skating you wear your helmet right
# yeah
# afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike
# he wanted to ride all by himself
# he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
# Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered
# and he fell into the
# oh no
# I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
# for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out
# he watched as his friends rode off without him
# they were becoming great explorers on their bikes
# what are they on here
# a bridge
# that's Rabbit's bike
# that &-uh is Bear's bike
# &-uh oh oh my gosh Honey you're absolutely right
# you're right
# you know what the purple one must be Fox's
# right oh my gosh you're good
# I didn't even realize
# right
# you're right and the blue one's Bear's cause Bear is big right
# right
# right
# on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house
# that looks like fun said Franklin's mother
# I can't ride without my training wheels groaned Franklin
# did you give it your best effort asked his mother
# well said Franklin maybe I could try one more time
# Franklin sat on his bike
# it's tippy he cried
# his mother held on to the seat try it I won't let you go until you tell me to
# Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bicycle from behind
# he felt very unsteady and very unsure
# I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling
# riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother but you can't give up just because it's frustrating
# it's too hard for me said Franklin it was easy for my friends
# do you think everything comes easily for them she asked
# Franklin had to think about that
# Franklin went to the park he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars
# each time she got_to the third rung she fell into the sand below
# no Beaver said Bear do it like this it's easy
# easy for you said Beaver she tried one more time and fell again
# maybe tomorrow Beaver grumbled
# did you go on the monkey bars at school yesterday
# what did we do we went this one then the next one then the next one then the next one then we
# then you fell
# but I caught you right you didn't really fall
# Franklin remembered when Beav when Badger learned to swim she was afraid to put her head underwater
# it's easy said Franklin just do it
# Badger had spluttered and cried it took her a long time to feel good in the water
# but now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other
# I think she's swimming underwater
# are you gonna swim underwater one day
# yeah
# with goggles like Phoebe wow that's going to be neat
# Franklin thought about the first time Fox played baseball
# he couldn't hit the ball at all
# but he tried and tried until one day Fox got a home run
# he's playing baseball
# like Daddy's team right
# well Rabbit's just hoping that Fox can hit the ball
# he wants Fox to do well right
# and he's waiting to catch the ball he's got his mitt on
# and if Fox hits the ball Rabbit is gonna get ready to catch it
# that would be great
# right Rabbit's gonna catch that ball wow
# just then Porcupine came by she moved very slowly
# she pointed to the pads on her knees wrists and elbows
# they make me feel funny she said but they keep me safe
# that's it cried Franklin and he hurried home
# Franklin put on
# padding
# he lined the walk with old pillows
# I'm ready to try again he told his mother and now I won't worry if I fall
# Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat
# Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and he fell many times but he never gave up
# then it happened Franklin told his mother to let go
# he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash
# way to go cheered his mother
# Franklin was thrilled
# finally he was riding his bike all by himself
# I can do it he shouted
# Franklin rode to the park to show his friends
# look at me he called
# Franklin tried to signal with one hand like Beaver but he toppled over I think I'll work on that he laughed
# not everything is as easy as it looks
# sure
# sure do you want Frog and Toad

# Frog ran up to the path to Toad's house
# he knocked on the front door
# there was no answer
# Toad Toad shouted Frog wake up it's spring
# said a voice from inside the house
# Toad Toad cried Frog the sun is shining the snow is melting wake up
# I'm not here said the voice
# Frog walked into the house it was dark
# all the shutters were closed
# Toad where are you called Frog
# go away said the voice from a corner of the room
# Toad was lying in
# oh my gosh
# he had pulled all the covers over his head
# Frog pushed Toad out of bed
# pushed him out of the house and on to the front porch
# Toad blinked in the bright sun
# help said Toad I can't see anything
# are you dripping on my arm Angel
# a little lollipop drip
# I do you're right
# oh you're right maybe if you kiss it it will be better
# thank you very much feels better already
# mhm
# but I can't see anything said Toad in the bright sun
# don't be silly said Frog
# what you see is the clear warm light of April
# and it means we can begin a whole new year together Toad
# think of it said Frog we'll skip through the meadows we'll run through the woods we'll swim in the river in the evenings we will sit right here on this front porch and count the stars
# you can count them Frog said Toad I will be too tired I'm going back to
# right
# Toad went back into the house
# he got into the bed and pulled the covers back up over his head again
# but Toad cried Frog you'll miss all the fun
# listen Frog said Toad how long have I been asleep
# you've been asleep since November said Frog
# well answered Toad a little more sleep will not hurt me
# come back again and wake me up at half past May
# good_night Frog
# but Toad said Frog I'll be lonely until then
# Toad did not answer he had fallen asleep
# Frog looked at Toad's calendar
# the November page was still on top
# so Frog tore off November tore off December January February March came to April
# Frog tore off the April page too
# then Frog ran back to Toad's bed
# Toad wake up it's May now
# what said Toad can it be May so soon
# yes said Frog look at your calendar
# Toad looked at the calendar and the May page was on top
# why it is May said Toad and climbed out of bed
# then he and Frog ran outside to see how the world was looking in the spring
# wow
# the story you sure know all the titles don't you
# the story
# one day in summer Frog was not feeling well
# oh Frog you are looking quite green said Toad
# but I always look green said Frog I'm a frog
# well today you look very green even for a frog
# he's a toad
# and he's a frog
# right

# would you like a sip of your water with your pumpkin straw
# that is one great straw
# wait til Daddy sees that
# he'll be so excited
# how are you

# a tiger
# and what's Kathy gonna be
# you're right and what's Lily gonna be
# a mermaid oh my gosh are we gonna have such fun
# okay get into my bed and rest said Toad
# Toad made Frog a cup of hot tea
# Frog drank the tea and then he said tell me a story while I'm resting
# alright said Toad
# let me think of a story to tell you
# Toad thought and thought
# but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
# I will go out on the front porch and walk up and down said Toad
# perhaps that will help me to think of a story
# Toad walked up and down on the porch for a long time
# but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
# then Toad went into the house and stood on his head
# why are you standing on your head asked Frog
# I hope that if I stand on my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad
# Toad stood on his head for a long time
# but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
# then Toad poured a glass of water over his head
# why are you pouring water over your head asked Frog
# I hope that if I pour water over my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad
# Toad poured many glasses of water over his head but he still could not think of a story
# well chewing lollies is not good for your teeth
# well you definitely can't chew without teeth but you have teeth but it's better to lick it instead of chew it
# right cause that could hurt your teeth
# right
# right and you know what if you lick it it lasts a lot longer than if you chewed it
# it's true
# yummy yummy yummy
# that's one red tongue you have
# then Toad began to bang his head against the wall
# why are you banging your head against the wall asked Frog
# I hope that if I bang my head against the wall hard enough it will help me think of a story
# he has a headache
# cause he banged his head against the wall oh no
# well he has a headache now he hurt his head
# right
# I'm feeling much better now Toad said Frog I don't think I need a story anymore
# oh then you get out of bed and let me get in said Toad because I feel terrible
# would you like me to tell you a story Toad
# yes said Toad if you know one
# once upon a time said Frog there were two good friends
# a Frog and a
# right
# the frog was not feeling well and asked his friend the toad to tell him a story
# but the toad couldn't think of a story
# he walked up and down but he couldn't think of one
# he stood on his head but he couldn't think of one
# he poured water over his head but he still couldn't think of one and he banged his head against the wall but still could not think of a story
# then the toad did not feel so well and the frog was feeling better
# so the toad went to bed and the frog got up and told him a story
# the end
# how was that Toad said Frog
# but Toad didn't answer he had fallen
# right
# do you wanna help Mommy make a cup of tea
# what's this one called
# the lost button
# Toad and Frog went for a long walk
# they walked across they walked in the woods and along the river
# at last they went back to Toad's house
# oh drat said Toad not only do my feet hurt but I have lost one of my
# buttons
# oh don't worry said Frog we'll go back to all the places where we walked and you will soon find your button
# they walked back tall grass
# here's your button cried Frog
# oh that's not my button said Toad my butt my button is white and that button is black
# so Toad put the black button in his pocket
# a sparrow flew down excuse me said the sparrow did you lose a button because I found one
# well that's not my button said Toad that button has two holes and mine had four holes
# Toad put the button in his pocket
# they went back to the woods and looked on the dark path
# here's your button said Frog
# oh that's not my button cried Toad that button is small and my button was big
# big but Toad put the small button in his pocket
# &-uh who's that
# a raccoon came out I heard you were looking for a button he said here's one that I found
# well that's not my button wailed Toad that button is square and my button is round
# but he put the square button in his pocket
# the button yes I think it has holes
# I think it has four holes but it's square instead of round
# Frog and Toad went back to the river and looked for the button in the mud
# here's your button said Frog
# oh that's not my button shouted Toad that button is thin and my button was thick
# Toad put the thin button in his pocket
# he was very angry
# he jumped up and down and screamed
# our whole world is covered with buttons and not one of them is mine
# Toad ran home and slammed the door
# there on the floor he saw his white four holed big round thick button
# oh said Toad it was here all the time
# what a lot of trouble I have made for Frog
# Toad took all the buttons out of his pocket and took his sewing box down from the shelf
# then he sewed the buttons all over his jacket
# the next day Toad gave his jacket to Frog
# Frog thought it was beautiful
# he put it on and jumped for joy
# none of the buttons fell off
# Toad had sewed them on very well
# yay
# oh my you are so drippy oh no

# Toad and Frog
# let me get a little wipe for you
# oopsie
# let me wipe your chin
# and one more time boop

# Toad and Frog went down to the river
# what a day for a swim said Frog
# yes said Toad I will go behind these rocks and put on my bathing suit
# I don't wear a bathing suit said Frog
# well I do said Toad and after I put on my bathing suit you must not look at me until I get into the water
# why not asked Frog
# because I look
# I look funny in my bathing suit that's why
# Frog closed his eyes when Toad came out from behind the rocks
# Frog and Toad jumped in the water and swam all afternoon
# Frog swam fast and made big splashes
# Toad swam slowly and made smaller splashes
# a turtle came along the riverbank
# Frog tell that turtle to go away said Toad I don't want him to see me in my bathing suit
# Frog swam over to the turtle
# turtle you'll have_to go away because Toad thinks he looks funny in his bathing suit and he doesn't want you to see him
# some lizards were sitting nearby
# does Toad really look funny in his bathing suit they asked
# a snake crawled out of the grass
# if Toad looks funny in his bathing suit I for one want to see him
# we want to see him too said the dragonflies
# me too said field mice
# field mouse I haven't seen anything funny in a long time
# Frog swam to Toad
# did you drip on me
# I dripped on you
# I don't have anything to drip silly girl
# I did but I don't have a lolly you have a lolly
# I did
# oh when I was cleaning your face

# yeah do you love your big girl bed
# oh yes sorry
# I'm sorry Toad said Frog everyone wants to see how you look
# I will stay right here until they go away said Toad
# the turtle and the lizards and the snake and the dragonflies and the field mouse all sat on the river bank and waited for Toad to come out of the water
# oh please go away cried Frog
# but no one went away
# Toad was getting colder and colder
# he was beginning to shiver and sneeze
# I will have_to get out of the water he said I'm catching
# a cold
# Toad climbed out of the river and the water dripped out of his bathing suit and down on to his feet
# the turtle laughed the lizards laughed the snake laughed the field mouse laughed and Frog laughed
# right
# what are you laughing at Frog said Toad
# I'm laughing because you do look funny in your bathing suit said Frog
# of course I do said Toad and picked up his clothes and went home
# what's this one called
# oh the letter yes it's true
# Toad was sitting on his front porch when Frog came along and said what's the matter Toad you look sad
# yes said Toad this is my sad time of day
# it's the time when I wait for the mail to come and it makes me very
# very unhappy cause he thinks he's not gonna get any mail right
# one more chin wipe
# I never get any mail said Toad
# not ever asked Frog
# no never said Toad
# no one has ever sent me a letter
# every day my mailbox is empty and that is why waiting for the mail is a sad time for me
# Frog and Toad sat on the porch feeling sad together
# then Frog said I have_to go home now Toad there's something I must do
# Frog hurried home
# he found a pencil and a piece of paper
# he wrote on the paper
# he put the paper in an envelope and on the envelope he wrote a letter for
# Toad
# he ran out of his house and saw a snail that he knew
# snail said Frog please take this letter to Toad's house and put it in his mailbox
# sure said the snail right away
# then Frog ran back to Toad's house Toad was in bed taking a nap
# Toad said Frog I think you should get up and wait for the mail
# no said Toad I'm tired of waiting for the mail
# Toad said Frog you never know when someone may send you a letter
# no I don't think anyone will ever send me a letter
# Frog looked out of the window the snail was not there yet
# but Toad someone might send you a letter today
# don't be silly said Toad no one ever sent me a letter before and no one's going to send me a letter today
# the snail was still not there
# Frog why do you keep looking out of the window asked Toad
# because I'm waiting for the mail said Frog
# but there will not be any said Toad
# yes there will said Frog because I sent you
# a letter
# you have said Toad why did you what did you write in the letter
# I wrote dear Toad I am glad you are my best friend your best friend Frog
# oh said Toad that makes a very good letter
# and Frog and Toad went out to the front porch to wait for the mail
# and they sat there feeling happy together
# Frog and Toad waited a long time
# four days later the snail got_to Toad's house and gave him the letter from Frog

# climb on up
# what book is this called
# the Lion king
# can I have a kiss
# I love you
# can I have a hug
# mm
# every morning as the sun peaks over the horizon a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light
# this is Pride rock
# home to my good friend king
# who is that
# that's king Mufasa
# and his lovely wife queen Sarabi
# on this particular morning animals from all over the Pride lands had come to Pride rock to celebrate the birth of their newborn cub Simba
# as part of the celebration I had a special duty
# I cracked open a gourd dipped my finger inside and made a mark on Simba's forehead
# then I lifted the future king up high for all to see
# the elephants trumpeted with their trunks the monkeys jumped up and down and the zebras stamped their hoofs with happiness
# what animals do you see
# you're right where are the monkeys
# here they are and what else do you see
# uhhuh
# and what else
# the elephants and do you remember what this is
# what kind of animal is that
# I think it might be a mandrill
# think so
# not far from the ceremony in a cave at the back side of Pride rock a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled life's not fair I shall never be king
# who's that
# that's Mufasa's brother Scar who was jealous of Simba's position as the next king
# moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave
# Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba he said
# Zazu Mufasa's trusted advisor also appeared
# you should have been first in line
# I was first in line until that little hair ball was born he said and Scar stalked out of the cave
# that's Zazu
# he's a bird right
# uhhuh
# before long Simba grew into a healthy playful young cub
# early one morning he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock
# as they looked out at the rising sun Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands
# look Simba he said everything the light touches is our kingdom
# Simba scanned the horizon and noticed a dark spot in the distance
# what about that shadowy place
# that's beyond our borders you must never go there Simba
# but I thought a king can do whatever he wants
# there's more to being king than getting your way all the time
# everything you see exists together in a delicate balance
# as king you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures
# from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope
# we're all connected in the great Circle of life
# later as Simba headed back down the path he ran into Scar
# hey uncle Scar guess what I'm gonna be king of Pride rock
# my dad showed me the whole kingdom and I'm gonna rule it all
# Scar looked slyly at the young cub
# he didn't show you what's beyond that rise of the northern border
# well no he said I couldn't go there
# oh he's right it's far too dangerous
# only the bravest lions go there
# hello
# &-er
# when Simba returned home he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi
# come on I just heard about this great place
# the mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go as long as Zazu went with them
# Simba and Nala raced across the Pride lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird
# they led him through many herds of animals until they finally lost him
# once the cubs were free of Zazu Simba pounced on Nala
# then Nala flipped Simba onto his back
# they tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones
# Simba looked around and gasped
# this is it we made it
# but before the cubs could explore any farther Zazu tracked them down
# we're way beyond the boundary of the Pride lands and right now we are all in very real danger
# who's that
# who are those
# what kind of animals are they
# are they cows
# are they horses
# what are they
# are they mice
# are they deer
# moose
# kitty
# what are they
# they're hy
# hy
# aren't they hyenas
# yeah
# do hyenas laugh a lot
# yes
# what 0are their names
# do you remember one name
# one of the hyena's names
# Mary
# Joe
# Bobo
# what did Maria say that day to Tamar at the play
# Toma Toma
# you're very giggly today
# okay do you remember any of their names
# why are you so what's so silly
# what's so funny Banzai
# Shenzi
# and the always laughing Ed
# Banzai grabbed Zazu by the neck and plopped him down
# hyenas circled their prey licking their chops
# what's the hurry we'd love you to stick around for dinner
# while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom Simba Nala and Zazu quickly slipped away
# but the hyenas weren't distracted for long
# they gave chase and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could
# finally they tried hiding behind some elephant bones
# just when it looked as if it were all over for the young cubs Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with one swipe of his big paw
# if you ever come near my son again he said
# the hyenas slinked away and Mufasa glared at Simba
# you deliberately disobeyed me I'm very disappointed
# Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son
# Simba peered up at his father
# I was just trying to be brave like you
# well their home is back in the Pride lands but right now they're just looking at the ah at the stars right
# are they twinkly
# sparkly
# do you still have all three rings
# mhm
# wow nice
# Dad we're pals right and we'll always be together right said Simba
# Mufasa looked up at the stars
# Simba let me tell you something my father told me
# look at the stars
# great kings of the past look down on us from these stars
# so whenever you feel alone just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
# meanwhile the hyenas received another visitor
# an angry Scar showed up at their lair
# I practically gift wrapped those cubs and you couldn't even dispose of them he said
# Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared
# be prepared for what Banzai laughed
# for the death of the king said Scar
# the following day Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge
# when they arrived Scar turned to his young nephew
# now you wait here your father has a marvelous surprise for you
# moments after he left Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeest directly
# well he has some hair on his head
# mhm
# aha
# Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeest directly towards Simba
# they've just a tiny little tiny bit of hair
# and ears too they have ears too right
# right
# hm hm hm
# goodness
# from a distance Mufasa noticed the rising dust
# Scar appeared quickly at his side
# stampede in the gorge Simba's down there
# without waiting a second Mufasa took off to save his young son
# I guess he'd have_to jump
# Mufasa plunged into the gourd and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests
# he found Simba grabbed him the nape of his neck and pulled him onto a nearby ledge
# but suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede
# desperately he tried to climb up another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him
# help me Brother he said
# Scar reached for Mufasa and pulled him close enough to whisper in his ear long live the king and let go of Mufasa
# Simba peered over the ridge just as his father disappeared beneath the thundering stampede
# later Scar found Simba hovering over his father sobbing
# it was an accident I didn't mean for it to happen
# what am I going to do
# run away Simba said Scar run away and never return
# Simba to did as he was told unaware that his uncle's hyena friends had been ordered to finish him off
# Scar returned to Pride rock to take over the throne
# meanwhile Simba plodded across the Savanna without any food or water
# it wasn't long before he fainted under the hot hot sun
# as the vultures circled overhead a big hearted wart
# he turned to his trusty pal a fast talking meerkat named Timon
# he's so cute and all alone can we keep him
# Pumbaa are you nuts lions eat guys like us
# but Pumbaa scooped Simba him up anyway and carried him to safety
# when Simba awoke the first thing that sprang to his mind was his father
# Timon taught him about hakuna matata which means no responsibilities and no worries
# you've got_to put your past behind you he said and that's exactly what Simba did
# he stayed in the jungle with Pumbaa and Timon a long long time and grew into a very big lion
# but eventually he got homesick
# and one night he looked at the stars and recalled the words his father had told him a long time ago
# the next day Pumbaa was stalked and chased by a lioness
# who is that
# who's that
# it's Nala
# Nala what are you doing here
# why didn't you come back to Pride rock you're the king she said
# I'm not the king Scar is
# Simba he let the hyenas take over the Pride lands there's no food or water and if you don't come back soon everyone will be in trouble you're our only hope
# I can't go back
# Simba yelled at the heavens you said you'd always be there for me but you're not
# because of me
# Simba didn't believe he could challenge Scar to the throne so he stayed in the jungle with Nala and his new friends
# but I knew the time had come for Simba to take his place in the circle of life and I headed for the jungle
# when Simba saw me he was surprised
# who are you
# question is I asked who are you
# I thought I knew but now I'm not so sure
# well I know who you are you're Mufasa's boy
# I led Simba to a reflecting pool
# when he looked in the water he saw a lion
# that's not my father it's just my reflection
# look harder he lives in you I said
# the ghost of Mufasa magically appeared
# look inside yourself Simba you are more than what you have become
# you must take your place in the Circle of life
# that's the ghost of his father of king Mufasa
# yeah well scary but he's still nice
# he looks a little scary but he's still very nice
# yeah
# when Simba arrived back at Pride rock he found the land bare and dry
# the hyenas were in control and Scar was shouting at Simba's mother
# suddenly a flash of lightning revealed the edge of Pride rock and there stood Simba
# Scar jumped back
# Simba I'm a little surprised to see you alive
# give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart said Simba
# Scar started to slink off but he turned and lunged one last time at Simba
# Simba moved quickly and flipped Scar over the edge where a pack of hyenas were waiting hungrily
# limping badly Simba climbed to the top of Pride rock
# he let out a magnificent roar as he looked over his kingdom
# before long Pride rock flourished again
# Nala remained by Simba's side and soon they had their own newborn cub
# with their friends around including Zazu Pumbaa and Timon a new celebration of life took place
# after making a mark on the forehead of the young cub I held him up for all the kingdom to see
# oh let's read a different book Sweetie pie
# a different one
# miss rings rings rings
# oops hold on to the ring Honey
# did you drop one
# well look at the ones you have and figure out which one you dropped
# well which ones do you have in your hand

# mhm
# climb on up
# what's this called
# Ariel and who's that
# wow
# one morning the little mermaid Ariel went looking for hidden treasure with her best friend Flounder
# Ariel was supposed to sing for the first time in front of her father king Triton and the other mer
# but for now she was much more interested in sunken ships than her father's concert
# what's that
# a shark
# that's right he has such big teeth
# while they searched Flounder began to get nervous
# what was that he asked did you hear something
# suddenly a very large shark smashed through the side of the ship

# waving a red bag and waving to Mrs Bear
# leaving one tasty cake at each sleepy door all by himself
# that's right there were two cakes left in two red bags
# that's right
# for us whispered Sam
# of course said Mrs Bear
# the sun was just sunning up the little white house
# hello house said Sam as they went inside kicking off their boots
# Mrs Bear poured cocoa in cups and they wriggled their toes in fat socks enjoying their cakes with cocoa

# home to my good friend king Mufasa and his lovely wife queen Sarabi
# on this particular morning animals from all over the Pride lands had journeyed to Pride rock to honor the birth of their newborn cub Simba
# as part of the celebration I had a special duty
# do you know what kind of animal he is
# what does he look like to you
# looks kind of like a mandrill to me
# you think so
# hm kay
# I cracked open a gourd dipped my finger inside and made a mark on Simba's forehead

# life's not fair I shall never be king
# who's this
# oh that's Scar
# who was jealous of Simba's position as the next king
# moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave
# Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba
# Zazu Mufasa's trusted advisor also appeared
# you should have been first in line
# I was first in line until the little hair ball was born said Scar and he stalked out of the cave
# that's Zazu
# yeah
# before long Simba grew into a healthy playful young cub
# early one morning he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock
# as they looked out at the rising sun Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands
# yes Honey

# yes
# should we try and make this so it's all one color or do you like it with lots_of different colors
# alright
# so let's stretch it out a little bit let's put it down and we'll make a crocodile okay

# hm
# that's nice cutting Honey
# are you makin little pieces
# yeah
# would you like me to read the book to you Honey
# you wanna finish Lion king or you wanna read Franklin
# alright let's see where we were
# later as Simba headed down the path he ran into Scar
# hey uncle Scar guess what I'm gonna be king of Pride land
# of Pride rock
# my dad just showed me the whole kingdom and I'm gonna rule it all
# Scar looked slyly at the young cub
# he didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border did he
# well no he said I can't go there
# oh he's right said Scar it's far too dangerous
# only the bravest lions go there
# when Simba returned home he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi
# come on I just heard about this great place he said
# the mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go as long as Zazu went with them
# Simba and Nala raced across the Pride lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird
# Nala led him through many herds of animals until they finally lost him
# once the cubs were free of Zazu Simba pounced on Nala
# then Nala flipped Simba onto his back
# they tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones
# Simba looked around and gasped
# this is it we made it
# before the cubs could explore any farther Zazu tracked them down
# we're way beyond the boundary of the Pride lands he said
# and right now we're all in very real danger
# suddenly three hyenas slithered out of the eye sockets of an elephant skull
# frightened Simba Zazu and Nala jumped back
# it was Banzai his partner Shenzi and the always laughing Ed
# Banzai sneered a trio of trespassers
# Zazu tried to lead the cuds cubs to safety but Zanzai gra Banzai grabbed him by the neck and plopped him down
# the hyenas circled their prey licking their chops
# you know what Sweets can we keep that on the table
# we don't want it to get stuck all over the rug right
# nope
# let's still read Lion king
# kay
# &-uh the hyenas circled their prey licking their chops
# what's the hurry we'd love you to stick around for dinner they said
# while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom Simba Nala and Zazu quickly slipped away
# but the hyenas weren't distracted for long
# they gave chase and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could
# finally they tried hiding behind some elephant bones
# just when it looked as if it was all over for the young cubs Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw
# if you ever come near my son again he said
# the hyenas slinked away and Mufasa glared at Simba
# you deliberately disobeyed me I'm very disappointed in you
# Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son
# Simba peered up at his father
# I was just trying to be brave like you he said
# being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble he said
# Dad we're pail we're pals right and we'll always be together right
# Mufasa looked up at the stars
# Simba let me tell you something my father told me
# look at the stars
# the great kings of the past look down on us from those stars so whenever you feel alone just remember those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
# do you remember where did we see stars on the ceiling
# did we go to the science museum in Boston
# and we went to that planetarium
# where all the stars were all over the sky
# wasn't that neat
# yeah
# is there any Playdoh on the floor
# thank you very much
# Mommy has to go blow her nose one more time
# I'll be right back
# okay
# is there <another &
# I think it may have been
# I think perhaps so
# oh yeah
# okay Baby
# that is a whole lot of Playdoh whoopie
# oh okay one big ball huh
# wow good luck
# that's a big job
# doo doo doo doo
# wow
# nice going Honey
# oh alrighty
# let's see
# the following day Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge
# when they arrived Scar turned to his young nephew
# you wait here your father has a marvelous surprise for you
# moments after he left Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeest directly towards Simba
# from a distance Mufasa noticed the rising dust
# Scar appeared quickly at his side and said stampede in the gorge Simba's down there
# without waiting a second Mufasa took off to save his young son
# Mufasa plunged into the gorge and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests
# he found Simba grabbed him by the nape of his neck and put him on a nearby ledge
# suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede
# desperately he tried to climb up another ledge from which star Scar stood looking down on him
# help me Brother he said
# Scar reached for Mufasa and pulled him close enough to whisper long live the king
# and then let go of Mufasa
# ooh gotta watch that Playdoh
# Simba peered over the ridge
# ooh Sweets can you pick that up please
# &-uh
# no I think you can pick it up Sweetie cause you dropped it on the floor
# can you pick it up before it gets stepped on Sweetie
# alright well I'll finish reading the book when you pick your Playdoh up
# what are you making
# really
# oh
# it looks like something very neat
# doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
# you're a little stuffy
# a little bit stuffy
# yeah
# what should we do with that Playdoh that's on the ground
# cause I see a piece right between us
# and I'm still waiting for you to pick it up
# that's good cutting Honey
# squishy
# what color do you think that Playdoh looks like
# a little red
# no
# it does look like grey you're right
# what else is grey
# oh the sky is blue and grey
# wow
# what about cars does anyone you know have a grey car
# you're right Nancy does have a grey car
# wow
# so true
# that's some good cutting Honey
# what are you gonna do once you cut it all into pieces
# oh you're gonna put it all back together into one big ball
# that's going to be great
# are you hungry Sweetie
# no
# thank you very much
# thank you
# all back together into one big pile
# ooh it's so squishy
# whoa
# that is some very hairy squishy Playdoh
# yeah
# okay
# alrighty
# okay which one should we read first
# Paddington
# do you remember what this one's called
# what's this one called
# Paddington's lucky day
# wow
# one day not long after Paddington went to live with the Browns at number thirty two Windsor gardens Mrs Brown thought she would take him out shopping
# we're going to the Portobello Road explained Judy
# it's a big outdoor market quite near here
# you should bring your pocket money added Jonathan there's a lot to see
# do you remember that I told you that Mommy and Daddy went to Portobello Road and bought something
# do you remember what it was that we bought
# you know the there's a little picture above your armoire in your room
# it's a picture of a mommy and her little girl
# and Daddy and I bought that at Portobello Road
# yeah
# before we even had you
# cause we knew we were gonna have a little Lily
# yeah
# Mommy might have_to make some tea for herself so she doesn't cough okay
# we'll finish this first though
# Paddington didn't need asking twice and soon afterward they all set off
# suddenly they turned a corner and Paddington found himself in what seemed like a different world
# a world of outdoor stands and push carts gold and silver ornaments books old furniture fruit vegetables people
# his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in
# one store was even having its picture taken
# that's a new supermarket said Judy there must be something special going on there
# Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the glass
# perhaps I could do some shopping for you Mrs Brown he asked hopefully
# Mrs Brown hesitated she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon
# but Jonathan told her not to worry even Paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said
# what goes in must come out
# we can meet him by the checkout counter on our way back added Judy
# Paddington felt most important as he entered the store
# he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door and then consulted Mrs Brown's shopping list
# everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans
# there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade
# he could certainly see why it was called a super market
# what do you like to get at the supermarket
# you like to get drinks at the supermarket
# that's true we do have_to get some drinks don't we we have_to get some juice and some milk
# what else do you like to get at the supermarket
# lemonade
# excellent any food that you like to get at the supermarket
# &-um even more drinks wow
# that's a lot of drinks
# his paws were soon full and he was just beginning to wish he had left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming toward him pushing a large basket on wheels
# may I suggest you use one of these sir he called
# you can take as much as you want now he continued
# can I really exclaimed Paddington
# the manager nodded yes we like to make our customers happy
# Paddington looked most impressed
# in that case he said I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure
# the more Paddington saw at the supermarket the more he liked
# he felt sure Mrs Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries
# the other customers looked on in amazement
# perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady
# what's she wearing
# she is wearing some glasses you're right
# whoop
# but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddinton with interest
# since he had been in the store the manager had been joined by several other important looking men
# and as Paddington reached the checkout counter one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap
# what do you see in his basket
# yeah wh do you see anything that you recognize
# I think I see some
# right there's some chicken over there and some
# right bananas
# and
# celery that's right that's celery
# do you know what this one is here
# that is actually looks just like lettuce that I think is cauliflower
# right
# yeah
# you don't
# Mommy likes cauliflower
# really okay
# really which cousins don't like cauliflower
# oh they don't like cauliflower either
# oh none of the three of you like cauliflower huh
# well you're right Daddy doesn't like cauliflower
# I think Auntie likes cauliflower
# and Mommy likes cauliflower
# great
# Paddington had never been to a store where they tried so hard to make their customers happy
# and he gave the men a friendly wave as he unloaded his baskets
# well done said the lady handing him a ticket
# I hope you've brought a truck with you
# there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here
# Paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw
# hundred and fifty dollars worth he said giving the man who had said he could take as much as he wanted one of his hardest stares
# he opened his suitcase and peered inside
# but I've only got a nickel
# yeah
# what's he going to do
# oh no
# looking up Paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him
# watch out cried the lady as he made a grab for his groceries but it was too late
# with a roar like an express train everything began to tumble down off the counter
# Paddington was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the Browns rushed into the store to see what was going on
# all in all he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being
# she has a surprised face I think
# she's going what happened
# that's what she's saying
# where's Paddington
# cause he's hiding under all the groceries
# there he is
# great
# you wouldn't think said the manager that giving someone a prize would be so difficult
# a prize echoed the Browns
# the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall
# this young bear he said happens to be our one thousan thousandth customer today
# perhaps you'd like to tell him he's won a free supp supply of groceries
# all of which said Judy as they staggered home laden with groceries only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet
# even in supermarkets agreed Jonathan
# Paddington sniffed the air happily
# I like the Portobello Road he said I think I shall always do my shopping here from now on
# yay

# Franklin rides a bike
# Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run
# he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swings
# did you climb the monkey bars at school
# yeah
# yes that's right you were taking turns
# but Franklin had a problem
# he couldn't ride his bicycle without training wheels
# in the spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes
# Beaver was the brave one and she took her wheels off first
# she practiced and practiced
# she took the training wheels off see she has no little wheels on the back
# look at me she shouted I can ride my bike all by myself
# Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles
# it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handlebar with the other
# Franklin's training wheels are right here
# oh yeah he's not his bike must be off
# out of the picture
# soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels
# maybe I think you're right
# right
# afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike
# he wanted to ride all by himself
# he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
# Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered then he fell into the flower bed
# I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
# whoa
# for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out
# he watched as his friends rode off without him
# they were becoming great explorers on their bikes
# there's Badger too you're right
# on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house
# that looks like fun said Franklin's mother
# I can't ride without my training wheels said Franklin
# did you give it your best effort asked his mother
# well said Franklin maybe I could try one more time
# Franklin sat on his bike it's tippy he cried
# his mother held on to the seat
# try it I won't let you go until you tell me to
# Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bike from behind
# he felt unsteady and very unsure
# I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling
# riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother
# but you can't give up just because it's frustrating
# it's too hard for me said Franklin it was easy for my friends
# do you think everything comes easily for him she asked
# Franklin had to think about that
# Franklin went to the park
# he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars
# each time she got_to the third rung she fell to the sand below

# then he woke his parents
# look that's Franklin's pink eraser
# he has an eraser like yours but yours has a little bee on it
# right
# right
# mhm
# right
# hurry he said to his parents I can't be late for school
# Franklin's mother looked at the clock
# even the teacher's not awake she laughed it's too early
# you must be very excited said Franklin's father
# Franklin nodded
# it was so early that there was time to make a big breakfast
# you'll need a full tummy to work at school said Franklin's father
# Franklin wasn't hungry
# I already have a full tummy he said it feels like it's full of jumping frogs
# Franklin's mother gave him a hug
# I felt that way on my first day of too my first day of school too but the funny feeling went away
# Franklin ate a little bit and double checked his book
# finally it was time to go to school
# halfway to the bus
# I don't wanna go he said
# Franklin's father gave him a hug
# that's how I felt when I started school he said but look all your friends are waiting for the bus too
# that's a good question
# is that Beaver's mommy
# no it's not
# ah I dunno it looks a little more like an otter to me than a beaver doesn't it
# yeah let's see
# there were there was a big crowd at the bus
# there were brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers
# Beaver was carrying her favorite book
# I can read it she said
# ah it's Franklin's friend Snail
# all of it asked Bear
# yes Beaver answered proudly
# Franklin rubbed his tummy
# Rabbit pulled out a brand new notebook
# my big sister showed me how to write my numbers he said
# all of them asked Fox
# most of them boasted Rabbit
# Franklin looked at his mother
# I wanna go home he said
# we'll be here after school to hear all about the things you did today she said
# when the bus arrived Rabbit grabbed his sister's hand and climbed aboard
# Bear stood on the steps and waved goodbye again and again
# Franklin hugged his mother and then his father
# he kept hugging even after his friends had found seats
# as the bus pulled away Franklin looked out the window
# he didn't know if he was ready for school
# do you think the teacher will yell wondered Rabbit who jumped at loud noises
# do you think there's a bathroom asked Beaver fidgeting in her seat
# I hope someone has an extra snack said Bear who had already eaten his
# Franklin didn't say anything
# the bus ride seemed very very long
# oh gosh I wonder
# I wonder who that could be
# maybe
# oh could be the otter you're right
# right
# yeah
# or it could be the raccoon too right
# there's the raccoon
# yeah
# I dunno maybe he was sitting in a different seat
# oh yes
# when they arrived their teacher was waiting
# Mr owl said hello in a gentle voice
# he showed them where to hang their coats and where to sit
# he showed them
# it looks like they're playing with Playdoh
# yeah
# he showed them where to find the bathroom and offered everyone a piece of fruit
# then Beaver and Bear went to the reading and writing center
# Rabbit went to the play kitchen
# but Franklin stayed in his seat
# well we'll have_to ask him
# what would you like to do today Franklin asked Mr owl
# I don't know said Franklin rubbing his tummy
# well he's a lil nervous on his first day of school
# I can't write all the numbers like Rabbit can and I can't read like Beaver can
# Rabbit and Beaver will learn new things at school and so will you
# Franklin started to doodle
# I can see you're a very good artist said Mr Mr owl
# Franklin stood up
# Franklin sat up taller
# I know all my colors too he said
# what color is this asked Mr owl holding up a colored pencil
# it's a special blue said Franklin
# it's turquoise
# now you've taught me something said Mr owl
# is there something special you would like to learn
# there were so many things that Franklin wanted to learn that he had trouble deciding
# finally he asked Mr Owl to help him read his favorite book
# he made a building of blocks
# he sorted the money in the classroom store and he painted four pictures
# one for the teacher one for himself and two for his parents
# it was a wonderful day
# Franklin sat at the back of the bus all the way home
# he bumped up and down ooh don't hurt your boo
# do you want another bandaid
# he was so busy
# what do you want
# okay can I finish the book and then I'll go get blankie
# he was so busy having fun he almost forgot to get off at his stop
# his parents were waiting
# how's your tummy they asked
# Franklin looked puzzled it had been such a good day he'd forgot all about his jumpy tummy
# my tummy's empty he said
# well that's a feeling that will go away too said his father
# I made this for you said Franklin's mother and gave him his favorite snack fly pie
# and I made this for you said Franklin and gave his parents two pictures and two big hugs
# shall I get you a bandaid and blankie

# why don't we go pick one out
# yeah
# let's see what we have
# Franklin
# okay
# we should get some of your books out of the car later
# sweet pea we have books in the car
# alright
# Franklin and the thunderstorm
# honey let's not put Silly_Putty in our hair
# okay but we don't want it in our hair cause we don't want it to get stuck
# well then we'd have_to cut it out or something
# I know that would that's true but I still don't know if we'd be able to get it out
# Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
# oh great
# you know what
# I love you
# Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
# he could name the months of the year and all the seasons
# he could read the thermometer and he checked the barometer every day
# Franklin worried about the weather because he was afraid of storms
# one day Franklin was supposed to play at fox's house but the sky was getting dark and the clouds were thick
# maybe I shouldn't go Franklin said to his mother
# she looked out the window it probably won't rain until later she said you've got time to get to fox's
# Franklin put on his boots and took the umbrella
# as Franklin hurried to fox's house he kept looking at the sky the clouds moved quickly and the winds swirled dirt in the air
# Franklin felt all jumpy inside
# fox was playing outside when Franklin arrived Franklin pointed nervously to the sky I think we should go inside don't you he asked
# not yet fox grinned I love watching the clouds move and feel the wind blow it's exciting
# I think it's scary said Franklin
# is Franklin a lil scared
# yeah
# beaver snail and hawk came over to play too
# my fur feels funny when it's about to storm said fox
# my feathers get all ruffled said hawk beaver sniffed I can smell a storm coming
# hm who do you think lives in here
# oh snail lives in that little
# I think he does
# that's a cute little house for snail donchou think
# mhm
# the wind became stronger and hawk flew loop
# Franklin held on to his hat and shivered it was almost as dark as night when big fat raindrops began to fall
# we should go in shouted Franklin
# no said fox follow me and they raced to the tree
# do you think that's a good idea to go to the tree
# no
# you could get hurt in a tree
# fox called his mother it's time to come in it's alright said fox we're in the tree
# fox's mother was there in a second it's dangerous to be near a tree during a storm she said
# lighting strikes tall things first and you might get hurt
# right
# you sure were right
# Franklin held on to fox's mother all the way from the tree to the house they were barely in the door when there was a flash of zig_zag light
# lightening shrieked Franklin he trembled
# thunder he screamed
# that's okay Franklin said his friends we're safe here
# but Franklin has crawled deep inside his shell fox's mother brought treats but still Franklin wouldn't come out
# Franklin's friends begged him to play but Franklin stayed put
# then with a flash and a crash the lights went out
# don't worry said fox's mother she lit candles and turned on a flashlight
# won't you come out now she asked Franklin
# no thank you said Franklin
# don't be afraid said hawk all that noise is just cloud giants playing drums in the sky
# Franklin peeked out really he asked
# no it's not giggled snail that noise is when the giants go bowling
# Franklin came out of his shell what about lightening he asked
# oh that's easy said hawk the cloud giants are turning their lights on and off
# fox smiled I think it's the giants swinging from their chandeliers
# Franklin laughed
# giants that's ridiculous said beaver Mister_Owl said that lightening is a big spark of electricity that travels from the sky to the ground
# the spark is so hot it makes the air around it pop and that's the sound of thunder
# amazing said Franklin
# Franklin felt a little better he even played flashlight tag with his friends
# soon there was hardly any lightening the thunder was a low rumble from far away and the rain stopped
# then the lights when on the storms over said fox let's go outside and play
# look said Franklin a rainbow
# I know why the storm is over Franklin said those giants heard there's a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow and they've gone to find it
# even beaver had to smile
# wow
# it sure does
# look at that
# should I make a lil tiny ball
# okay
# looks kind of like a little egg doesn't it
# yeah
# wow
# oh boy

# thank you
# oh thank you
# should we read
# should we read your prehistoric animals
# alrighty
# the prehistoric animals included in this book are just a few of the strange and interesting creatures that once roamed our planet
# huh what's that
# a woolly mammoth
# wow
# sure
# woolly mammoths were a type of prehistoric elephant the woolly mammoth which was distinguished by its long shaggy hair was almost thirteen feet tall
# and appeared about two million years ago during the Ice_Age
# right what was the one that we saw at the Pequot museum remember we saw one
# oh the mastodon
# right
# looks similar
# right
# during the Ice_Age massive ice sheets called glaciers covered vast areas of land
# because it had a thick layer of fat under its skin as well as abundant hair the woolly mammoth managed to keep warm in the year round winter
# crash
# yeah I think so
# the mammoth lost relatively little body heat through it's ears
# boom
# it's ears were very small
# it's long curved tusks enabled it to find food by clearing away snow and ice
# woolly mammoths have been found preserved in the frozen tundra of Siberia
# prehistoric man who probably hunted them for food decorated caves with drawings of these magnificent animals
# wow
# very long
# huh who's this
# the saber
# oh my gosh his tusks are going in his mouth
# wow
# there we go
# the scientific name for the saber tooth tiger is
# does that sound better
# you think Machairodont
# this group included many different kinds of cats all of which had long fangs in their upper jaws
# these cats were carnivores or meat eaters and use their sharp sharp teeth to pierce the thick skins of the plant eating animals
# one of the best know saber
# exact
# yeah Smiladon sounds like mastodon
# they're both Latin names
# hello smarty
# the Machrauchenia
# wow
# Machrauchenia means large throat
# Machrauchenia was a plant eater or an herbivore that
# achoo
# what a long nose he has
# achoo
# the Machrauchenia was about eleven feet tall and was shaped like a camel but with no humps
# fossils show that its nose openings were high up on the skull suggesting that it had some sort of trunk
# it woulduv used its trunk as an elephant does today to obtain food and water
# since each of its toes were hoofed Machrauchenia would've been able to run quickly to escape predators
# huh what's this
# that is the Brontotherium
# &-uh it sounds like a brontosaurus right
# it looks more like what
# what animal does the Brontotherium look like
# kinduv like a hippo kinduv like a rhinoceros
# yeah I think so
# Brontotherium was a plant eater that grew up to eight feet tall
# although it looked like a modern day rhinoceros the two animals are only distantly related
# Brontotherium lived in the warm forest and had a large forked horn on its snout that was shaped like a y do you see its horn
# yeah here's the y shaped one now up here see
# that's his nose
# his snout
# yeah
# okay what comes next
# huh you remember
# right
# wow this is a Thorahockis
# yes
# that one goes
# oh the woolly mammoth
# he goes
# hello I'm a woolly mammoth
# I'm a saber
# I'm a tiger
# you're right
# right I'm a Machrauchenia
# what's that
# that's the Brontotherium
# yes
# hello
# I'm a Brontotherium
# huh
# hello I'm a Thorahockis
# like kkinduv like an ostrich right
# yeah or an emu
# right
# hello I'm a bird
# huh
# hello I'm a giant sloth
# wow that is one big sloth huh
# yeah let's see what it says about the sloth here
# it says the giant sloth was truly huge about twenty feet long from nose to tail
# I'm huge
# let's see this one says we're strange creatures
# the woolly mammoth says I have long tusks and wooly hair
# &-um this one says
# that one says the wooly hair has the woolly mammoth has long shaggy hair and is just thirteen feet tall
# this one says the saber
# this one says the Machrauchenia has a long trunklike nose
# the Brontotherium says that the Brontotherium ate leaves and fruit from the trees
# the Thorahockis says that the birds could not fly they ran on their feet
# mhm
# the Machrauchenia says I have a long nose
# it says that the Machrauchenia was eleven feet tall and looked like a camel with no humps
# the Brontotherium says that they had horns and they used to fight each other with their horns
# this one says that there were lots_of unusual creatures
# it says the woolly mammoth had pretty small ears
# that says that the woolly mammoth lived during the Ice_Age
# it says that one of the saber
# it had long knife like teeth which were over six inches long
# the Machrauchenia says that it ate plants
# mhm
# and a long trunk like nose
# wow
# achoo
# achoo
# the Brontotherium says they had a y shaped forked horn on the top of their snout
# the Thorahockis says it was about five feet tall and had a long neck and small wings
# because the wings were so small they could not use them to fly instead the wings may have helped the bird to maintain balance while it ran on its powerful legs
# yummy
# huh the giant sloth had long curved claws and fed by stripping leaves with its tongue
# but when the giant sloth was on the ground its claws forced the animal to walk on the sides of its feet making movement difficult
# yeah
# although its slow progress made the giant sloth an easy target for meat eaters its claws served as effective weapons
# the giant sloth probably only became extinct about eleven million years ago
# interesting
# mhm
# that is a neat book
# yeah
# well it says that lots_of interesting creatures roamed the earth millions of years ago
# they were the predecessors to lots_of the animals that we see today
# ah the giant sloth
# he says I'm truly huge
# yeah
# huh the woolly mammoth
# saber
# oh no she's not
# the Machrauchenia
# oh my gosh is that a rhinoceros
# the Brontotherium
# oh is that an ostrich
# that's a Thorahockis you're right
# oh my gosh that's truly huge what is it
# hm

# can you ask nicely
# please
# which one
# ah let's see
# this one is that's what friends are for do you want that one
# that one is oh oop ouch
# there's so many books in there it's hard to get out
# let me see
# really
# you want the tooth fairy book
# look what I found over here though
# the tooth fairy
# mhm
# okay I can't you know what I can't get that one out because it's too far back
# I think that's the everything book
# okay well why don't we read the tooth fairy first and then I'll have_to work on digging that other one out
# yeah
# right
# you're right
# this is the tooth fairy
# she has lots_of teeth
# she has lots_of dimes and quarters too
# she needs them because when you are asleep she comes and takes away the tooth that you have put under your pillow
# and she puts the money there instead
# sometimes she forgets and then of course your tooth is still there in the morning instead of the money
# that this is because she works so hard
# the tooth fairy has to work harder than the Easter bunny because the Easter bunny only works on Easter
# the tooth fairy works harder than Santa Claus because there's only one night when Santa goes down all those chimneys but the tooth fairy is busy every night
# that's Santa with a big sack of toys
# if she forgets to take your tooth one night she usually remembers it the next
# she will take your tooth home with her along with all the others she has collected that night
# when she gets home the first thing she does with your teeth is to sort them
# lower teeth extra teeth bottom teeth teeny teeth very clean teeth
# girl's teeth boy's teeth shiny teeth first teeth small teeth
# she puts some of the pretty ones in a glass jar on a high shelf in the kitchen she thinks they look nice there
# they do look nice there don't they
# yeah
# pretty
# she puts some in the bottom of the fish
# she makes some into necklaces and some into bracelets she has more necklaces and bracelets than anyone
# she just loves jewelry
# of course every other fairy knows what kind of birthday presents she will get from the tooth fairy
# the pathway to her house is paved with teeth
# and there are always stars outside her window at night
# at least it looks that way because she has hung clothes
# well it's a pretty decoration I think
# oh really
# thank you
# I do need a little trim
# well we'll just pretend
# snip snip snip
# snip snip snip
# snip snip snip
# how does it look

# Snow White is so sweet and gentle she makes lots_of friends wherever she goes
# she is always cheerful and looks on the bright side
# she is romantic and longs to meet her true love
# she is also very practical and works very hard
# that's important mhm
# you ate all the Pez
# mhm
# the purple Pez you can have after lunch
# mhm
# yes
# oh you can't have lunch okay well then if you can't have lunch then you can't have Pez
# okay should we read about Snow White
# with hair as black as ebony and lips as red as roses and skin as white as snow this lovely princess is perfectly named Snow White
# not only is she beautiful but she is sweet natured too
# everyone loves her except of course her vain and jealous stepmother the queen
# her favorite things include singing and dancing which always cheer her up and give her courage when she's afraid
# telling stories is one of Snow White's great talents the seven dwarfs like to listen to her stories about the day her prince will come and how they'll live in a beautiful castle
# the animals and birds of the forest love Snow White's kind and gentle nature
# they even helped her clean up the dwarves' messy cottage
# Snow White loves to walk in the enchanted forest and pick pretty flowers
# but she can't things into the too many flowers into the cottage because flowers make Sneezy sneeze
# when dwarfs when the dwarfs find out that Snow White is a good cook they are delighted even more so when they discover she can bake their favorite gooseberry pie
# yeah
# Snow White's world Snow White lives in an enchanted land with seven jeweled hills and seven waterfalls
# beyond the farthest hill stands the castle where she grew up with her wicked stepmother
# mhm
# right it's true
# Snow White has nowhere to go and gets lost in the dense forest
# eventually she can run no farther and she falls to the ground in tears oh
# the seven hills really are jeweled because there are dazzling diamonds inside
# the seven dwarfs love to dig dig dig all day long in the diamond mines
# oh_my_goodness
# so this is where Snow White grew up
# and this is where the dwarfs live
# and that's the prince's castle
# and
# and the waterfalls
# mhm
# well this is when Snow White is ah lost in the dark forest
# right
# right
# right she got lost but the nice animals helped her out right
# and they took her to the seven dwarves' cottage
# right
# one of the great gifts that Snow White has is the ability to make friends easily
# the animals and dwarfs would do anything for her even Grumpy
# but the queen is madly jealous of her naturally beautiful stepdaughter and the cruel queen is a very dangerous enemy to have
# as well as being Snow White's stepmother
# mhm
# right it says here as well as being Snow White's stepmother the queen is also a wicked witch
# she does not like Snow White and she uses a poison apple to try and get rid of her
# my_goodness
# that's not nice at all
# no no no
# mhm
# right it's true there is the poison apple
# right
# right
# no no
# the seven dwarfs and the birds and animals that meet Snow White love her dearly
# they try to protect her from the wicked queen and her spells
# although the huntsman is a loyal servant of the queen
# that's Grumpy Dock Bashful Sneezy Happy Dopey and Sleepy
# he is always so sleepy isn't he
# there's Sneezy
# choo
# that's right he's always sneezing
# that's right
# here's the huntsman he's a loyal servant of the queen but he is not wicked
# seeing Snow White's sweet nature he cannot bear to carry out the queen's orders and hurt the princess
# well but he decides he cannot hurt Snow White
# he doesn't want to hurt her so he lets her go
# right
# no it's not nice that he promised to do it in the first place right
# you're so soft
# yes
# that's the queen's castle
# where Snow White grew up
# mm
# not so good
# nope nope nope nope
# from the moment that Snow White becomes more beautiful than the queen her life is in danger
# although the seven dwarfs tried their best they cannot protect her from the queen's black magic
# but good is stronger than evil
# and in the end the prince's love for Snow White saves the day
# well at first he thinks he's going to hurt Snow White
# but then he changes his mind he can't bring himself to harm her
# and he tells Snow White to run away from the queen
# yeah
# mhm
# right
# disguised as an old peddler woman the queen persuades trusting Snow White to take a bite of the poisoned apple
# she promises it will make her dream come true
# yes
# right
# as soon as Snow White takes a bite of the apple she falls to the ground in a deep sleep and cannot be woken
# when the dwarves find her they place her in a special glass coffin
# yes
# she is very very mean you're right
# mhm
# but the dwarfs and Snow White
# right
# but Snow White and the dwarfs and the prince are all very nice aren't they
# yeah
# you're so right
# she is not nice at all
# no no no no no
# he does not look so nice there either you're right
# Cinderella
# about Cinderella she is cheerful and sunny no matter how difficult things are
# she is hard working and practical and she can cook and sew
# she's very caring and heart is full of kindness
# that's nice
# poor Cinderella is made to work as a servant by her cruel stepmother and her spoiled stepsisters
# but she never stops hoping and believing that one day her life will change
# although they are only tiny mice Gus and Jack are Cinderella's loyal friends
# they help her with her chores and save her from being lonely mhm

# let's see
# Cinderella has no money to spend on clothes so her animal friends help her to patch up a simple dress an apron each morning and shine her worn out shoes
# the birds and mice sew frills and bows on an old dress that once belonged to her mother so that Cinderella can go to the ball
# uhhuh
# well we don't get to meet her mother
# yeah
# well Cinderella was with her mother when she was younger
# right
# that's right hello belly girl
# once upon a time the manor house was the happiest place in the whole kingdom
# but when Cinderella's mean stepmother arrived things changed
# Lady Chrimain made Cinderella sleep in the attic and do chores all day
# Lady Chrimain is her stepmother
# Anastasia and Drizella
# oh_my_goodness gracious
# oh no
# right right
# right
# right
# no
# this is the kitchen where Cinderella spends much of her day cooking and cleaning
# every morning Cinderella feeds the animals before she takes breakfast to her stepmother in bed
# mhm
# yes
# right
# right
# right
# mhm
# right
# yes that was good
# a little magic is all Cinderella needs to find happiness
# she has charm and beauty and all the elegance of a princess
# and with a little help from her fairy godmother her dreams come true
# to celebrate the prince's return all eligible ladies in the land are invited to attend a ball at the castle
# well they are so jealous of Cinderella that they tear her outfit to pieces
# oh no
# but with a wave of her magic wand the fairy godmother ensures that Cinderella can go to the ball
# mhm
# oh no
# as soon as their eyes meet at the ball Cinderella and the prince fall in love
# but when the clock strikes mid &-uh midnight Cinderella leaves her glass slipper behind on the stairs in a hurry to leave before the magic ends
# soon her dress
# right
# but she leaves it there
# and the grand duke is absolutely delighted when Cinderella produces the matching glass slipper and puts it on her dainty foot
# right
# that's true
# after all his searching Prince Charming has at last found the beautiful girl he danced with at the ball and the whole kingdom rejoices when he marries Cinderella

# on the bus our teacher told us about some of the animal exhibits that we should see
# Lisa had been to the museum before and she said there was something even better dinosaurs so big one of their footprints could make a swimming pool for us
# the museum was very interesting our teacher showed us everything
# butterflies monkey tigers elephants and even the skeleton of a whale
# but the exhibit of extinct animals was the most exciting

# yeah
# that's right
# Gaspard and Lisa our classmates joked you look like extinct animals
# the museum may want to keep you forever
# everyone laughed except for Lisa and me but it gave me an idea
# Lisa let's play a joke on our classmates I said and I told her my plan
# first we made two little signs and then we crept under the bars
# we put the signs in front of us and froze like statues
# I had forgotten to take off my scarf but our classmates didn't notice
# some of them even took pictures of us
# lots_of pictures
# our plan worked perfectly
# so perfectly that our class left without us
# the lights went out and the door closed oh no
# we were locked in the museum
# what's to become of us Lisa cried
# don't be afraid I answered we'll find something to eat we'll go to sleep and tomorrow we'll leave
# but the only thing to eat were dinosaur bones and in the dark they were sort of scary
# it was terrible being locked in the dark suddenly the dinosaurs started growling
# ah we shouted help
# but it wasn't the dinosaur it was the guard's dog who came to rescue us
# our teacher and classmates were happy to see us and boy were we happy to see them
# yeah
# okay
# let's put this one back
# hey
# yikes
# yikes
# wow oh really wow
# Nemo loved everything about school
# he loved swimming there everyday with his dad
# he loved his classmates he loved his teachers and he loved to learn
# and he really loved field trips
# even though on his very first trip he was fish_napped by a scuba diving dentist and brought to an office aquarium in Sydney
# but that's another story
# every morning Nemo's dad Marlin would take him to school
# along the way Nemo always liked to ask his dad lots_of questions
# what's a whale's tongue like
# how many clown
# why are we called clown
# we're not funny at all
# Nemo saw his best friends Tadpole and Sheldon they loved to play tag and algae in the middle before school started
# Mr Ray was on school yard duty that morning he was everyone's favorite teacher
# Nemo and his friends had a special song they made up just for him
# he's our favorite teacher hip hip hooray
# before the big spotted manta we love Mr Ray
# then it was time for school to begin the first class of the day was music taught by
# Senor Seaweed
# Nemo and his classmates were getting ready for the spring concert
# Nemo played the conch shell Sheldon played the clams Tad strummed along on some kelp and Pearl played sand
# Mr Ray taught science
# today's lesson was your ocean home
# Mr Ray called on Nemo where do you live Nemo
# anemone I mean anemone
# I mean
# where does Nemo live
# an anemone that's right
# while the rest of us would be hurt by its stings Nemo brushes himself against the anemone every day
# I guess Tad lives in the ocean
# hm really I think just clown
# yup
# hm that's interesting
# then it was lunchtime
# there were lots_of lunchroom rules
# no inking in the lunch area
# mhm
# uhoh

# yeah
# mhm
# I think so yeah
# mhm
# which blue and green fish
# oh
# I think that is a boy
# yeah
# Nemo took out his lunch
# I'll trade you my kelp sandwich for your algae pizza he said to Tad
# yum said Tad
# mhm
# yeah
# that's right
# after lunch was recess yay
# everyone had fun playing hide and seek but then Sandy Plankton got in a bit of trouble
# it's like my dad always says says Nemo it's all fun and games until someone gets stuck in a giant clam
# oh no
# such a big big clam
# once Sandy was free it was time for Nemo's next class
# it turned out there was a guest teacher that day
# Dory
# hi Elmo she said waving to Nemo
# Elmo isn't Nemo
# Nemo's not Elmo
# you're right
# mhm
# no
# that's right
# Dory was teaching the class how to speak whale
# repeat after me she instructed
# that's good whale
# what did you say the class asked eagerly
# I just said hello said Dory
# then it was show and tell time Pearl brought in a cool piece of coral she had found and Sheldon the seahorse had some big news
# his dad was having babies
# who wants to go next asked Mr Hermit
# &-um oh Mr Hermit the crab see there's his little claws behind everyone
# these are his eyes
# see
# today I have some very special visitors for you all to meet
# come in guys
# Anchor Bruce and Chum swam in
# pleased ta meet ya said Chum
# don't worry kids we don't eat fish anymore well we try not to anyway
# after a quick question
# &-uh Chum said that
# I think so
# that's right
# after a brief question and answer period the sharks left everyone breathed a huge sigh of relief
# all too soon it was time to go home
# the students filled into the schoolyard to wait for their parents to pick them up
# Nemo couldn't wait to see his dad and tell him all the fun things that had happened
# they sand the rest of the Mr Ray song as they waited
# he's our science teacher we think he's swell
# sometimes we act goofy but he never does yell
# &
# soon Nemo's dad arrived how was your day today he asked Nemo as they swam home
# dad it was awesome Nemo cried Sandy got stuck in a clam Dory taught whale I brought in the sharks for show and tell
# I can't wait till tomorrow
# Marlin shook his head sadly I'm sorry Nemo I can't let you go to school tomorrow because
# it's Saturday
# you don't go to school on Saturday

# oh I dropped a little blob of butter
# which we havta throw away
# and I'll throw our butter box away
# you know what we could think about
# we could think about what we should have for dinner tonight
# beef stew you know what it's such a warm day and beef stew it should be colder to make beef stew cause it takes a long time to make and it gets the kitchen very hot
# so let's think
# what else could we make something
# yeah
# hm
# I could look in the freezer I think I might have some chicken in the freezer
# what could we make with chicken
# we could make a chicken salad maybe
# a lettuce salad I love lettuce salad
# I do daddy not as fond of lettuce salad
# you're right
# he could eat the chicken salad but not the lettuce salad right
# yeah that's true
# you're right
# what else could we put if we make chicken salad what could we put in it
# hm let's look in the fridge and see what we have that maybe we could put into our chicken salad
# we could put
# we don't have any celery
# we can't put celery in
# we have carrots
# these green beans are not looking so good
# I think I havta throw these away yup
# &-um we have apples
# we have some grapes
# oh thank you thank you
# byebye old rotten green beans
# we probably have onions
# we could put onions in
# let's see a little tomato pesto sauce
# huh you know what might be interesting actually
# let me see here
# I think yeah we have oh let's see what's in here
# we have a little chicken tikka sauce and I wonder if we could make a vinaigrette out of this although this sauce does not excite me so much but we could probably do that right
# yeah
# this sauce is not so exciting
# right chicken would be good
# let's see
# let's go look in a couple of cookbooks and see we could do I feel like we have peanut sauce a lot
# so maybe we shouldn't do peanut sauce
# whada you think
# right
# no no we're still in the kitchen
# I'm just coming in oh no look we're in here
# we're here with a bunch a cookie dough
# yeah
# what are you eating
# let's see
# alright
# let's think about this
# come into the kitchen with me
# we'll see if we can
# &-uh
# yeah that would be a good idea right
# okay so for instance
# &-um
# hm sour cherry vinaigrette that's interesting huh
# do you think we would like a sour cherry vinaigrette on our chicken salad
# well not so sour just a cherry cherry vinaigrette do you think that would be good on our chicken salad
# curry chicken salad I don't know how excited I am about that
# it could be good though
# curry dressing
# well I don't know whada you think of curry dressing
# would that be good
# you put some apples and some well daddy doesn't like raisins we could put grapes
# pepper
# some peanuts
# we don't usually have curry chicken salad that could be exciting I think right
# let's see which do you think sounds better
# curry chicken salad which is kind of a yellow color and we could put apples and grapes in it or do you think you would like a cherry vinaigrette
# whada you think
# oh I see
# oh that's good to know
# alright maybe we'll do that then
# excuse me
# goodness gracious
# who's in the green room

# alright
# here I come

# you don't wanna go to ballet anymore
# we signed up for this ballet class at the J C C with this friend of Lily's but they didn't tell and the class is all for like three year olds and stuff
# and we get in the class and the and I've taken a class with her there before where you know you just sit there and the kids are doing their thing and the teacher was like and it's in like a room with the door closed
# and she and no windows or anything
# and she's like parents aren't allowed in
# crack up
# like I put her in I left I hear screaming screaming
# I go back in I sit for a little bit I leave screaming screaming
# buhblah buhblah buhblah buhblah
# like Lily's friend said and you know they're all in little leotards and tights and everything and her friend said that she had to go to the bathroom and the woman was like you're supposed to go to the bathroom before you go to class
# with three year olds
# right and so she's like yes honey
# you felt better when I came into the classroom
# yeah
# &-um and &-uh and then she like points the other three year old to the bathroom and she's like there it is
# and she's got a leotard she's like I can't do it
# you know I mean so
# exactly
# it was so ridiculous
# I mean it was a cute they had like a little Hawaiian dance that was really cute and stuff but
# whatever
# I'm not gonna pay for her to like go hysterical every week
# and then like last week I was like okay we have ballet I don't wanna go
# whatever
# whatever
# that's what one of the dragon says on Dragon Tales
# who says that
# Wheezy does that right

# she does that with her hand too

# that's funny
# oh that's a good idea
# yes honey

# well but you know what remember last time mommy's glasses broke so I don't think I want donkey to climb on my glasses
# well cause we don't wanna buy yet another pair of glasses I think daddy would be unhappy if mommy bought yet another pair
# I seem to go through glasses rather quickly
# mhm
# don't hurt me donkey
# oh thanks donkey
# yeah
# sweets you wanna read a book
# book
# should we read a book
# wouldjou like to pick one out
# alright
# we could also play dominos too if you want
# wow
# you'd rather read Dot
# well okay
# hi there my name's Dot
# actually I'm princess Dot next in line to be queen of the whole ant hill
# of course my sister Ada's actually queen now so I'll most likely be a princess for a long time
# don't get me wrong I like being a princess
# but to be honest with you I'd rather play around and be a member of my blueberry troop then perform royal duties
# and besides Ada's a good queen even though she worries a lot
# she's a whole lot better than she used to be I'll tell you that much
# when she was a queen in training she used to get upset about everything
# of course there used to be a lot to get upset over
# you see our ant hill used to be in a ton of trouble
# there were these big mean old grasshoppers who would come to collect most of the grain we harvested every year
# we were all terrified of those grasshoppers
# they barely left us enough food for ourselves for the winter
# poor Ada
# I have_to admit she was stepping up to the throne at a bad time
# now my friend Flick he's a really cool guy
# he's an inventor and let me tell you he can invent anything
# once he made a telescope out of a drop of water that he put inside a rolled up leaf
# anyway during the last harvest we ever did for the grasshoppers Flick invented a harvesting machine
# it was really neat but no one except me would listen to him and see what amazing things his machine could do
# maybe if they had things would've been different
# one day we heard the grasshoppers arriving so we all ran inside the ant hill Flick was left outside with his invention
# I told you Flick was cool but I didn't tell you he could be kinda clumsy too
# he ended up knocking the entire offering of grain over the ledge and into the river below
# now we were in awfully big trouble
# the grasshoppers got really mad and even picked me up and threatened to squish me
# ah that's an ant's worst nightmare
# ah
# oh my gosh a nightmare
# don't squish me
# no yeah she's just a little princess ant
# don't squish her
# Flick felt so bad he came up with a plan to make things better
# what's donkey doing
# is he eating your foot
# really
# really
# oh it looked like he was nibbling on your toe
# you're right
# now he has a necklace on
# wow
# oh it looks like a stethoscope
# well
# okay
# he decided to leave our island to go in search of warrior bugs to protect us
# no ant had ever left ant island before
# good luck Flick I shouted as he flew away on a dandelion puff
# nobody believed he could do it nobody expect me that is
# you just watch I said
# he'll get the bestest roughest bugs you've ever seen
# and guess what
# he did
# well sort of
# the only problem was that the warrior bugs Flick brought back were actually circus bugs
# it was a tiny mistake but it could still work out
# at least I thought it could
# Flick got the circus bugs and me and my whole blueberry troop to help him with his plan
# we made a giant fake bird out of leaves and twigs
# so when the grasshoppers return to get their food we would scare them by crawling inside the bird and flying it right at them
# it was a daring plan and Flick was great
# he was like the captain of our ship
# blueberries ready he asked when we were loaded inside the bird
# ready we shouted back
# then whoosh we were flying
# and we really scared those mean old grasshoppers
# they thought we were go they were going to get eaten by our bird
# but then we kinduv crashed
# none of us got hurt but the grasshoppers figured out what was going on
# and they realized we weren't a real bird after all
# but Flick was really brave he had stood up to the grasshoppers and gotten the whole colony to follow him
# and Ada helped him too together they fought off the biggest meanest grasshopper of them all
# in the end those mean old grasshoppers were scared away for good especially after a real live bird chased them down
# in the end the only sad part was that the circus bugs had to leave
# P_T_Flea owner of the circus asked Flick to join them too
# sure you can't tour with us he asked
# but Flick just said sorry my place is here
# anyway the circus bugs all promised to come back and visit us at our little ant hill
# and I sure hope they do
# in the meantime I think Ada has a crush on Flick
# I mean it's always been totally obvious that he had a crush on her but this is the first time I've seen her let him hold her hand and stuff
# I guess if I have_to have a brother in law Flick would be my first choice
# yes
# hm
# anyway I've gotta go now I wanna practice my flying before supper
# see ya later
# what happened to donkey
# hm
# really
# nothing at all huh

# a Carnotaur
# mhm
# are is a Carnotaur and a allosaurus the same thing
# really
# alright
# excellent
# okay should I read this
# Snuffy's favorite color
# okay
# concert day at Terrytown had been a big success
# everyone sand a song about his or her favorite color
# but Snuffy couldn't decide what his favorite color was so he sang a song about all the colors
# concert day was supersonic said Jay Jay as he flew up next to Snuffy
# your rainbow song was the best part of the show
# you must be feeling pretty good
# I am said Snuffy but everyone else picked a favorite color to sing about and I couldn't figure out my favorite color
# choosing a favorite color is one of the hardest things I'd ever tried to do
# hey Snuffy said Jay Jay I have an idea when I have trouble figuring something out I go see Brenda Blue
# that's a great idea thanks Jay Jay called Snuffy
# he headed toward Terrytown airport and Brenda Blue's workshop
# when Snuffy arrived at the workshop he found Brenda Blue working on a small motor
# hi Brenda said Snuffy hi Snuffy what's wrong asked Brenda
# I can't decide on a favorite color said Snuffy
# well it seems to me if something is your favorite color you probably see it a lot right asked Brenda
# yes said Snuffy I would probably see it every day
# and if something is your favorite you probably like it a lot too right asked Brenda
# yes said Snuffy if it's my favorite I'd really love it
# so you should figure out your favorite color based on the things you see today explained Brenda
# and pay special attention to what you love the most
# what a super idea thanks Brenda exclaimed Snuffy as he flew up into the sky
# mm
# neat
# how's that water
# mm
# oh what's that
# the sun what's it doing
# rising you're right
# that's exactly what it's doing
# Snuffy was ready to put his plan into action so he looked at the things around him
# mm the sun above me is yellow
# maybe yellow should be my favorite color he said
# but my sky writing smoke is white and so are the clouds so maybe white should be my favorite color
# hey Snuffy called Jay Jay how's it going
# I'm still trying to choose my favorite color replied Snuffy
# wanna join me for some crock water he asked Jay Jay
# that would be great answered Snuffy
# let's go fill up our water tanks suggested Jay Jay
# there you go guys said Brenda Blue your water tanks are filled to the brim
# thanks Brenda cheered Jay Jay I don't know what we'd do without you
# you're the best agreed Snuffy come on Snuffy we have work to do said Jay Jay
# and they taxied down the runway
# Jay Jay and Snuffy arrived at farmer Dale's field
# as they sprayed water on the crops Snuffy was thinking about what his favorite color might be
# mm parts of the field are brown so maybe brown should be my favorite color
# and the corn stalks are green so maybe green should be my favorite color
# but when the corn is picked it's yellow just like the sun that's two votes for yellow so maybe that should be my favorite color
# okay Snuffy said Jay Jay we have a lot of deliveries to make we'd better head back to Terrytown airport to refuel
# back at Terrytown airport Brenda Blue filled up their gas tanks
# you guys are refueled and ready to make your deliveries she said
# thanks Brenda called Jay Jay and Snuffy as they left the airport
# boy that Brenda Blue sure is a big help said Snuffy
# no kidding agreed Jay Jay she takes good care of us
# ooh look at that
# what's that
# yeah do you know what the building is called
# that's a barn
# right
# remember you have that book called big red barn
# yeah
# sure we'll look and see if we have it we'll read it okay
# when you were a little tiny lil tiny teeny tiny girl you used to read that book all the time and you could read that book to me
# mhm
# well but you memorized the whole book cause I used to read it to you all the time and you would every time I would turn the page you would read the book
# you would recite it
# I don't know if you remember it now we'll havta look for it
# while yes
# oh
# oh okay
# maybe I'll read it once and then you can read it once
# cause then you'll probably remember it
# oh alright
# while he was flying Snuffy thought to himself I love making deliveries so what colors do I see when I'm making them
# that big barn near the river is red
# maybe red should be my favorite color
# and the flowers of Smiley Meadow are purple and orange
# maybe one of those should be my favorite color
# the deliveries took them over the docks of Terrytown and Snuffy looked again for his favorite color
# wow look at those boats one's pink one's black another is gold
# maybe one of those colors is my favorite
# what are you thinking about Snuffy asked Jay Jay
# I'm still trying to figure out my favorite color
# well maybe you'll get lucky and it will come to like a flash of lightning said Jay Jay
# just then there was a flash of light and a rumbling sound in the sky
# whada you think that sound is
# thunder
# that doesn't sound good said Jay Jay
# the sky filled with clouds and the rain began to fall
# we better go home said Snuffy
# as Snuffy and Jay Jay flew back to Terrytown airport they got all wet but they knew when they arrived Brenda Blue would be waiting with a dry towel
# how are you feeling Snuffy asked Brenda as she finished drying him off
# I feel great replied Snuffy thanks
# good I wouldn't want you to get rusty she said
# okay Jay Jay it's your turn
# Snuffy moved to the hanger door and noticed a rainbow he remembered he hadn't picked a favorite color
# Brenda said I should think of something I love and that might help me choose
# and Brenda's always right thought Snuffy
# in fact Brenda's one of the most helpful people I know
# she fills our water tanks when they're empty she refuels us when we're out of gas she dries us off when we get wet and much more
# I sure do love Brenda a lot
# hey that's it said Snuffy I just figured out my favorite color
# that's great Snuffy said Jay Jay what is it not what said Snuffy who
# Blue Brenda Blue
# let me just get the phone sweetie

# the eels have the sparks to keep the current glowing
# oh see they're lighting up so everyone can see
# intensified electrified they keep the groove aflowing
# the whales keep on moving through each and every station and the fish crew keeps on cleaning
# while dancing in formation

# Angie is in the office
# she twists and shakes her fins
# while Gino cleans the blow hole
# he slips and slides and stims
# hey those look like stingrays don't they
# oh

# picking up the groove and scrubbing as they glide

# okay Sweetie I think that's Hok
# and that's Lok
# and that's Siew
# I think it's Sow wait let me check the pronunciation
# in the back
# do do yep Siew
# should I read
# kay
# three monks Hok Lok and Siew traveled along a mountain road
# they talked about cat whiskers the color of the sun and giving
# what makes one happy Siew asked Hok the youngest monk
# old Siew who was the wisest said let's find out
# this is Hok
# the sound of a bell brought their gaze to the rooftops of the village below
# oh yeah
# oh yeah you bet
# I've got it we're at five after nine now
# okay
# yes Sweetie
# sure you can
# it's right on top of the basket I think
# I just put it down there
# there it is
# your clock says it's ten fourteen
# I wonder if we could change the
# oh whoops sorry
# well now it says eleven sixteen
# can I put it back to the right time
# &-uh now it says ten fifteen
# yeah the clock mm well we moved our clocks back and this one we can't seem to change but that's okay
# okay
# ready
# ten fifteen
# mhm
# are we ready for our story
# okay
# the sound of a bell brought their gaze to the rooftops of a village below
# yes Sweetie
# what would you like
# hm
# how bout some mandarin oranges
# in a bowl they're so sweet and delicious
# how bout you wanna try one and see if you love them which I think you will
# Honey
# you want some cherry granola
# what would you like
# mm
# you have_to tell me
# mm
# okay
# hm hm
# or applesauce
# okay peach yogurt
# okay
# okay well Mommy's not hungry right now so I won't
# Sweetie then you'll have_to wait till later cause I'm not hungry now
# but you can eat some
# Honey I'm not hungry would you like some peach yogurt then
# Sweetie I'll share it with you later but I already had breakfast and I'm not hungry now
# Angel
# Lily I'll have two bites
# Sweetie you can't force other people to eat
# Sweetie I already told you I'd have two bites
# Sweetie
# okay but then I changed my mind and said I'd have two bites right
# fine three bites
# come on
# over the couch
# okay
# I thought you wanted to give it to me
# ooh that's big ooh
# okay
# the sound of a bell brought their gaze to the rooftops of a village below
# they could not see from so high above that the village had been through many hard times
# famine floods and war had made the villagers weary and untrusting of strangers
# they had even become suspicious of their neighbors
# the villagers worked hard but only for themselves
# there was a farmer a tea merchant a scholar a seamstress a doctor a carpenter and many others
# but they had little to do with one another
# that's the farmer
# the tea merchant
# the scholar which is like a teacher
# that's the carpenter
# the seamstress
# and the doctor
# when the monks reached the foot of the mountain the villagers disappeared into their houses
# no one came to the gates to greet them
# and when the people saw them enter the village they closed their windows tight
# the monks knocked on the door of the first house
# there was no answer
# then the house went dark
# they knocked on a second door and the same thing happened
# it happened again and again from one house to the next
# these people do not know happiness they all agreed
# but today said Siew his face as bright as the moon we will show them how to make stone soup
# they gathered twigs and branches and made a fire
# they place a small tin pot on top and filled it with water from the village well
# a brave little girl who had been watching came to them
# what are you doing she asked
# we're gathering twigs said Lok
# we're making a fire said Hok
# we're making stone soup and we need three round smooth stones said Siew
# the little girl helped the monks looked around the courtyard until they found just the right ones
# then they put them in the water to cook
# these stones will make excellent soup said Siew
# but this very small pot won't make much I'm afraid
# my mother has a bigger pot said the girl
# the little girl ran home
# as she started to take her pot her mother asked what she was doing
# the three strangers are making soup from stones she said they need our biggest pot
# hm said the girl's mother stones are easy to come by I'd like to learn how to do that
# the monks poked the coals
# as smoke drifted up the neighbors peered out from their windows
# a fire and a huge pot in the middle of the village was a true curiosity
# of course old style stone soup should be well seasoned with salt and pepper said Hok
# that is true said Lok as he stirred the giant pot filled with water and stones
# but we have none
# I have some salt and pepper said the scholar his eyes big with curiosity
# he disappeared and came back with salt and pepper and even a few other spices
# Siew took a taste
# last time we had soup stones of this size and color carrots made the broth very sweet
# carrots said the woman said a woman from the back I may have a few carrots
# but just a few and off she ran
# but she returned with as many carrots as she could carry carry as she dropped them into the pot
# think it's gonna be good
# do you think it would be better with onions asked Hok
# oh yes maybe an onion would taste good said a farmer and he hurried off
# he returned in a moment with five big onions and he dropped them into the bubbling soup
# now that's a fine soup he said
# the villagers all nodded their heads as the smell was very agreeable
# but if only we had some mushrooms said Siew rubbing his chin
# several villagers licked their lips
# a few dashed away and returned with fresh mushrooms noodles pea pods and carrots
# oh sorry not carrots cabbages
# we already have carrots don't
# yeah
# something magical began to happen among the villagers
# as each person opened their heart to give the next person gave even more
# and as this happened the soup grew richer and smelled more delicious
# I imagine the emperor would suggest we had dumplings said one villager
# and bean curds said another
# what about cloud ear and mung beans and yams cried some others
# and taro root and winter melon and baby corn cried the other villagers
# garlic ginger root soy sauce mini buds
# are we gonna put you in the soup
# are you a Lily bud
# you're just a Lily
# you're a Lily kid
# do you think we could put you in the soup and eat you up cause you're so tasty
# no
# oh darn
# there goes my snack
# you are so silly
# I have some I have some people cried out and off they ran returning with all they could carry
# the monks stirred and the pot bubbled
# how good it smelled
# how good it would taste how giving the villagers had become
# at last the soup was ready
# the villagers gathered together
# they brought rice and steamed buns they brought lychee nuts and sweet cakes they brought tea to drink and they lit lanterns
# everyone sat down to eat
# they had not been together for a feast like this for as long as anyone could remember
# after the banquet they told stories they sang songs and they celebrated long into the night
# then they unlocked their doors and took the monks into their homes and gave them very comfortable places to sleep
# in the gentle spring morning everyone gathered together near the willows to say farewell
# thank you for having us as your guests said the monks you have been most generous
# thank you said the villagers with the gifts you have given we will always have plenty
# you have shown us that sharing makes us all richer
# and to think said the monks being happy is as simple as making stone soup
# read this part
# stone soup has its traditional roots in European folklore but there are many versions of the story
# from France Sweden Russia England Belgium there are also related stories from Jamaica about a soup making pot and Korea about a magic cake tree and the Philippines about a bill paying hat
# in this retelling I took took the traditional form of the stone soup story and set it in China
# I also used the Buddhist story tradition where tricksters spread enlightenment rather than seeking gain for themselves
# the characters Hok Lok and Siew are prominent in Chinese folklore
# they are three deities that bestow health wealth and prosperity
# Hok symbolizes good fortune and prosperity
# Lok symbolizes good health family happiness and mutual love
# Siew symbolizes longevity and he brings good health and long life free from stress and obstacles

# hm
# who's that
# oh
# and who else
# king Triton
# wow
# welcome to Atlantica
# I'm princess Ariel
# I'm a mermaid but my father king Triton has a magical trident that can transform me into a
# human
# it's as a human that I now live with my husband prince Eric in our palace on dry land
# well how did that happen
# oh my gosh wow
# my father always told me to stay away from humans but I was so curious about them
# one of my favorite things to do was to explore sunken ships
# my best friend Flounder and I found the most wonderful human treasures inside them
# Daddy said humans were cruel but I knew that any creature who could make things as beautiful as those crea as those treasures couldn't be all bad
# one day I found something amazing
# back then I didn't know anything about the human world
# but our friend Scuttle the seagull did
# he told us it was a dingle_hopper and that humans used it to comb their hair
# was he right
# hm
# you're right that is so silly
# then Flounder and I swam to a secret cave where I kept my human treasures
# I turned on a music box and watched the tiny couple inside dance
# I wished I could dance and be part of the human world
# Flounder and I were arranging my treasures when a ship passed overhead
# we swam up to take a look
# suddenly a storm blew in
# powerful waves pushed the ship closer to the rocks near the shore
# then the human they called prince Eric fell overboard
# I dove underwater to rescue him and I was able to pull him to shore
# I had never been that close to a human before
# I couldn't take my eyes off of him
# I was so moved that I started to sing
# that's when Eric opened his eyes
# but then the prince's service servant sir Grimsby approached and I hid behind a rock and watched them walk away
# father's advisor Sebastian the crab suddenly appeared at my side
# we're going to forget this whole thing ever happened he said
# later on Daddy came into my secret cave
# Sebastian had told him everything
# Daddy was furious and lectured me about my responsibilities as a princess
# but I didn't want to be a princess I wanted to be a human girl
# Daddy ordered me to stay away from humans and I told him
# you're right

# ha ha
# Daddy ordered me to stay away from the humans but I told him I couldn't do that
# he lowered his trident and with a single blast destroyed all of my human treasures
# I put my head down and cried
# suddenly I felt something brush up against my arm
# at my side were two eels that belonged to the sea witch Ursula
# I had heard horrible stories about the sea witch but I was so upset I didn't care
# I wanted to see prince Eric again and I followed the eels to Ursula's cave to see if she could help me
# &-uh oh
# Ursula
# not so nice
# mm mm
# Ursula was very
# creepy
# creepy
# she's so creepy
# she offered to make me human for three days if I gave her my voice in exchange
# &-uh oh that doesn't look good
# she told me I would stay a human if prince Eric kissed me before the sunset on the third day
# don't what
# oh
# &-uh oh
# it doesn't look good
# I thought about what Daddy had said but I was determined to see prince Eric again
# as soon as I signed the contract my voice flowed into Ursula's seashell which was tied around her neck
# &-uh oh
# things are getting worse and worse
# I sat in the water and stared at my new legs
# they were amazing
# when I stood up I felt so heavy
# walking was very different from swimming or floating in the water
# I was really a human
# everyone disapproved of what I had done
# only Scuttle was excited for me
# Ursula is bad news scolded Sebastian
# but it was too late for a warning
# my friends had to help me find the prince if not I'd become Ursula's slave
# &-uh oh
# this doesn't sound good
# I think we're gonna have a problem
# luckily prince Eric found me on the beach
# you seem very familiar he said
# I wanted to tell him I was the one who had rescued him but I couldn't speak
# he led me to his palace
# it felt strange to walk but the prince held me tightly and helped me with each step
# his servant showed me to my room and I put on a pink gown
# at dinner prince Eric told me I looked beautiful
# I smiled dreamily
# it seemed like everything was falling into place
# the next day Eric and I went out on his rowboat
# Eric stopped the boat in a lagoon
# there he leaned over to me and just as we were about to kiss splash
# the boat flipped over
# the kiss would have_to wait
# oh no
# what are we g
# &-uh oh
# I awoke on the third day happier than before but when I saw Eric he was with another woman called Vanessa
# oh no
# what is going on
# this does not look good
# I heard him say our wedding ship departs at sunset
# I was crushed Eric was going to marry Vanessa
# what had gone wrong
# what
# I'd been certain that Eric had the same feelings for me as I did for him but now it was too late
# I watched as Eric and Vanessa's wedding ship sailed into the distance
# but Scuttle flew over and said I saw the bride in the mirror Vanessa is Ursula in disguise
# egads
# egads
# now I understood Ursula had tricked Eric into marrying her
# while Flounder pulled me onto the ship Scuttle and some other sea creatures swam ahead and interrupted the wedding dropping things on Vanessa and spraying her with water
# Scuttle snatched the necklace from Vanessa which fell to the ground and shattered and my voice flowed back to me
# and as loudly as I could I yelled Eric
# you're the one said Eric it was you all the time
# Eric leaned in to kiss me
# it's too late Vanessa shrieked
# the sun had just dropped below the horizon
# suddenly as I changed back into a mermaid Vanessa changed back into Ursula
# she is so creepy
# Ursula took me to my father and showed him the contract
# I might be willing to make an exchange Ursula said and Daddy agreed and took my place as Ursula's slave
# it's so sad
# what gonna happen now
# alright let's see
# I had to save Daddy and the kingdom so I followed Ursula
# she had used my father's trident to make herself monstrously huge
# oh no
# but while I distracted Ursula Eric grabbed the wheel of the ship and steered the bow right into Ursula's cold heart
# we had defeated the evil sea witch
# yay
# oh look what happens
# Daddy was free and he forgave me for my selfishness
# he also realized how much I loved Eric
# he touched the water with his trident and transformed my tail into legs again
# with his blessing Eric and I were married and lived happily ever after
# yay
# you want that one or do you want Jessie
# we haven't read Jessie in a while
# really
# what's this about

# hi there my name's Dot
# actually I'm princess Dot
# next in line to be queen of the whole
# ant hill
# of course my sister Adda is actually queen right now so I'll most likely be a princess for a long time
# you're right Adda was princess too and then there was a queen right
# oh great
# right
# don't get me wrong I like being a princess but to be honest with you I'd rather play around and be a member of my blueberry troupe than perform royal duties
# and besides Adda is a good queen even though she worries a lot
# however she's a whole lot better than she used to be I'll tell you that much
# when she was a queen in training she used to get upset over everything
# &-uh huh
# &-uh huh
# I we can't seem to find the cover for it
# I don't know
# yeah I'll look in a little bit okay
# our anthill used to be in a ton of trouble
# there were these big mean old
# grasshoppers who would come to collect most of the grain we harvested every year
# we were all terrified of those grasshoppers
# they barely left us enough food for ourselves in the winter
# poor Adda I have_to admit she was stepping up to the throne at a bad time
# now my friend Flik he is a really cool guy
# he is an inventor and let me tell you he can invent anything
# once he made a telescope out of a drop of water that he put inside a rolled up leaf
# anyway during the last harvest we ever did for the grasshoppers Flik invented a harvesting machine

# and then this gets clipped just like Mommy's
# should we read Harold's Trip to the Sky
# okay
# one night Harold got up made sure there was a moon so he wouldn't see things in the dark
# and went to get a drink of water
# he wondered about the things people see in the dark and where they came from
# he was glad he couldn't see them in the moonlight
# suddenly he realized he didn't see anything at all in the moonlight there was nothing to see
# he was in the middle of a desert
# no wonder he was so thirsty
# but luckily he had brought his purple crayon and he knew where to find water on the desert
# there was always a pool of it somewhere near a palm tree
# Harold drank deeply
# there's nothing like drinking nice cool water on a desert
# but there isn't much else to do on a desert
# Harold realized as he looked around except maybe play in the sand
# then he remembered how the
# then he remembered how the government has fun on the desert
# it shoots off rockets
# nineteen fifty six book
# Harold decided to go to the moon
# on a good fast rocket he figured he could get there and back in time for breakfast
# he fired the rocket and off he went
# but the rocket missed the moon
# it missed it by a mile
# and Harold went up and up
# up and
# there's the moon
# but he was going up up up in the dark
# where's he gonna land
# he tried to see where he was going by looking at the stars
# he tried planets and comets what he really needed to light his way was another moon
# when Harold looked closely what he saw wasn't a moon it was a flying saucer
# Harold had heard about flying saucers people saw them in the dark
# n nobody knew who was inside flying them
# he decided he'd better land his rocket right away
# and landed it with a bump on the bottom of a strange planet
# there was no danger falling off so big a planet
# however Harold thought he would feel a little bit more comfortable at the top of the planet
# he wondered what planet he was on
# in the dark light of the stars he looked for some sign that might tell him
# what planet is he on
# is he on Jupiter
# he's on Mars
# Harold had heard of men on Mars so he yelled a couple of hellos hopefully
# he thought of the flying saucer out there and thought of the things that people see in the dark
# he felt a great need for some company
# he was sure any man on Mars would be cordial to a visitor like Harold who had come all this way to chat with him
# he had to draw on his scanty knowledge of what a man on Mars looked like
# but his looks wouldn't really matter in the dark so Harold didn't care much what he turned out to look like
# all Harold wanted to know was there was some sort of friendly face close by
# then all of a sudden Harold did see it clearly
# it was the face of a thing
# it was a thing people see in the dark and it was sitting on a flying saucer
# and Harold ran away
# and he thought and stopped
# probably the thing was about to fly to Earth and scare somebody maybe a little child
# so bravely Harold crept back
# he approached on tiptoe so the thing wouldn't hear him
# and he reached out with his purple crayon
# and he put a completely damaging crack in the flying saucer
# before the thing could grab him he was off again chuckling triumphantly
# and ran as fast as he could in the dark
# happily most of the way was downhill
# he hoped he wouldn't fall head over heels
# he arrived safely heels over head at the bottom of Mars where the rocket was
# but by this time Harold had had enough of adventure he wanted to get home in a dependable way
# so he climbed down on the stars
# it was sure but it was slow
# and the points of the stars hurt Harold's feet
# Harold wished he were home
# and he recalled the best way to wish on a
# is on a good big shooting star
# instead of wishing it occurred to him at the last moment to jump aboard
# he shot right down to
# what planet does Harold live on
# well he was visiting Mars but what planet do we live on
# Earth right
# he shot right down to Earth where he made a neat two point landing
# he hadn't passed the moon on the way and he wondered what happened to it it wasn't anywhere around
# then he realized the night was just about gone and it was time for the sun to come up
# he was very hungry
# the sun appeared right on time
# it came up big and bright
# and Harold remarked it was going to be a very nice day
# nobody was even bothered by flying saucers and things in the sunshine
# but for a startled moment he thought he saw a flying saucer
# it was on the horizon looking as if it had just come in to land
# he was mistaken though it wasn't a saucer it was an oatmeal bowl
# Harold happened to like hot breakfasts and he quickly drew up a chair
# and sat down to
# eat
# yummy he's going to eat his breakfast
# what did you have for breakfast
# you had meat
# I don't think so I think you had a granola bar right
# and some blueberries
# some crackers
# uhuh actually means no Honey
# as opposed to
# yes
# you want what
# yes
# yes
# hooray
# yes
# yes
# no yes
# yes no
# yes
# oh you said yes
# you didn't
# did you make a funny face at me
# this one
# this is not Mommy's favorite book
# but I'll read it anyway
# the abridged version
# Laney Lamb and Lily Bunny were best friends
# everyday they met in the wildflower meadow just as the warm spring sun first sparkled on the morning dew
# hooray squealed Lily she hopped even higher than before did a somersault and landed gracefully in the soft spring grass
# awesome cried a strange deep voice
# but it wasn't Laney's voice and it wasn't Lily's voice
# there was a bright green frog
# that was excellent he croaked
# oh hello Fritz said Laney
# hi said Fritz the frog I hope I'm not interrupting you
# this is my friend Lily Bunny Laney said
# oh nice to meet you Fritz croaked
# but Lily just nodded at Fritz and looked away
# she didn't like the thought of sharing the meadow and her friend with a stranger
# Lily scowled she wanted Laney to pay attention to her
# but Laney was so busy performing for Fritz she didn't hear
# all that morning Laney played with Fritz while Lily stayed by herself at the far end of the me meadow
# come on Lily Laney bleated Fritz is picking watercress for us and it's delicious
# Lily stamped one of her big back feet and glared angrily at Laney
# look she said you can play with that frog all you want but if you're going to be friends with him you can't be friends with me
# why said Laney feeling very sad and confused
# because said Laney that's just the way it is
# the next morning Lily didn't go to the wildflower meadow but went to have breakfast on the other side of the grassy hill
# and there she met Penelope Pig
# well here's a surprise I thought you'd be with Laney
# you're best friends aren't you
# we were but now she wants to play with some frog
# well maybe I can help said Penelope I know a lot about friends and friendship
# the little what
# little lamb
# oh the little piggie
# yeah there's the Penelope Pig
# ah if I'm not mistaken you're upset because Laney wants to play with Fritz but it's perfectly fine to have more than
# she is big
# it's perfectly fine to have more than one good friend at a time
# friendship is the perfect thing to share and having more friends mean having more fun
# Penelope walked away leaving Lily alone
# Penelope thinks she's so smart Lily thought but she doesn't understand
# Lily started to eat but the plants were not as sweet as the ones by the pond
# and she heard the laughter and shouting of two voices
# she saw Laney and Fritz picking flowers together
# they've got some nerve she said making all that racket
# whatever they're doing they're certainly having fun they don't need my help and that's fine with me
# that afternoon Lily was sulking in the shade of a tree and Fritz hurried up and called Lily come quick Laney wants you right away
# what does she want Lily asked coldly but Fritz had already hurried back over the hill
# huh it's probably nothing but I'll still go and see she said
# when she got there she found Laney and Fritz proudly displaying a beautiful Lily sized necklace
# how do you like it said Laney
# is it for me she said
# we made it just for you said Laney because you're my very best friend
# and because I'd like to be your friend too Fritz said
# oh what a beautiful necklace she said I've been so selfish
# that's okay Laney said we didn't mean to leave you out I just got so excited about having a new friend that I forgot about our game
# I was selfish too
# well I'm sorry said Lily I hope it's not too late for us to have some fun together
# so for the rest of the day the three friends romped and frolicked in the meadow
# I'm glad to see Lily and Laney are friends again Penelope said
# it was my advice that got them back together you know
# early the next morning Lily Laney and Fritz met by the pond and all three had great fun together
# this spring will be the best ever because now I even have more friends than before
# yay
# you're gonna eat me up
# no
# oh you're eating
# what
# oh you're gonna sing twinkle twinkle little star
# alright let's hear it
# yay bravo
# how n
# thank you c_ds for Mommy
# oh my god I was watching some of Lily's
# these are the c_ds of when Jenny takes movies of us when she's here and then she brings us the little movies to play on the computer
# I was looking at ones of her when she was gosh maybe just two or like year and a half
# and &-uh and &-um Manuela was still here and she was going through the colors with her
# or it was a little book with different colors and pink was pink
# and purple was purple
# and flower flower flower
# flower you're so cute
# uhhuh
# oh where's your clip Babes
# I was talking about when you were talking when you were just learning to talk when you were a baby
# when you were a little girl
# oh yes
# yeah
# and the funny thing is she's gone through things where she'll become really obsessed with some field of study and at that point she must have been two or just like two and a quarter or something like that
# look at your mustache
# and she had a place mat with all with the United States an
# that's a good thing actually maybe we'll look at your map in a while cause now like I any recollection
# now she still
# yeah should we look at your map and see how many states you know now
# you used to know like half the states when you were two
# we probably don't even know that many now right
# so she'll go through things where she'll know like
# seriously my like
# geography study
# and dinosaur study has increased tenfold
# yes your map
# yeah but she'll be like oh I you know every other kid will be like I speak seven languages
# she'll be like I speak English slang English colloquial English
# we can probably do three in Spanish whatever Dora teaches you
# okay let's see
# where's your little oh Debbie was here Honey and I had to give her something then I forgot
# oh well oh well
# oh here's your map
# here's your little map
# and the other funny thing about Lily when she was doing all her states is she would only look at the &-um map of the United States upside down
# we would give it to her right side up and she would say no it's upside down and she would turn it over
# you are silly should we look at our states
# alright let's see what we can remember
# let's see
# do you remember
# Texas that's a big one
# and Florida sure
# yeah look at the teeny tiny
# that is Rhode Island
# right and do you remember this one
# that is New York you're right
# and let's see do you remember this big one over here
# this is the one where they
# that's right it's California
# let's see what else do you remember this one above Florida right above Florida
# that's the one where they grow peanuts
# Georgia
# oh my gosh wow okay do you remember this one
# I'll give you a hint you know who lives here
# no
# Alaska is actually over here which is really Alaska's really up here but it didn't fit in the map so they put it down here
# &-uh Matthew lives here
# Virginia right
# now let's see do you remember do you remember this one
# next to California
# oh cheese the cheese state is over here
# remember what the cheese state is called
# it's called Wisconsin
# this one is Nevada
# Nevada
# oh yeah
# oh you mean the states and stuff like that
# oh
# oh that's interesting
# &-um whether
# there we go why do you like to look at the map upside down
# you are so silly
# yes
# like that silly
# no that's the way Florida goes
# Florida's like a little tail
# at the end
# it's like a little leg
# let's see do you remember &-um
# let's see oh
# this state do you remember this one this is the one where David grew up
# do you remember what it is
# is it Minnesota
# no
# is it Kentucky
# no
# is it Montana
# what is it where did David grow up
# in Iowa
# I know one person actually grew up in Iowa and we know scary
# I know like how what is it like five people live there or something
# like everyone everyone's like in a cornfield
# yes Honey
# let's see what else
# yeah what's that one
# oh Virginia's the yellow one where Matthew lives remember
# that's South Carolina
# that's
# well if this is South Carolina what's this one
# North Carolina
# member
# Kansas
# Oklahoma
# New Mexico
# Arizona
# Washington state
# Oregon
# oh she probably thinks I know she probably thinks Mama's really smart
# Honey do you think the words are written here or do you think Mommy's just super smart and knows all her states
# you think I'm super smart
# thanks Babes
# that's this is the potato state
# Idaho potatoes
# I do love potatoes
# you know Mommy and Daddy went to Idaho once they went hot air ballooning
# yeah
# you know didn't Elmo go in a hot air balloon when you get in a little basket and it goes up up up up up
# yeah
# I think you should try that you want me to show you pictures of it I have pictures of it when we went
# okay let me find the pictures
# it was very fun Mommy thought it was more fun than Daddy
# but you know
# you know it was really cause I'm not like I never go on rollercoaster rides or anything like that
# &-um I don't like drops and you know like but it's so gradual like going up and across and down and you just feel like
# well you just feel like I guess the physics of it because like the heat rises and whatever that it's so simple that unless like you know some flying knife comes out and hits your balloon like that there's just not that much that can go assuming you're not cause they do weather reporting so you're not gonna get hopefully caught in a thunderstorm or whatever
# yeah let's see
# Daddy was saying we should take you to this place one day
# it's called &-um Yellowstone and they have all this bubbling
# so cool
# they have all this bubbling mud that they call the paint pots and it just sits in the ground and bubbles really it's hot
# and it makes noises and it's smelly
# the sulfur is smelly
# well because it's &-um sulfur smells like rotten eggs
# and look and so acidic it burned a hole right through the street
# look there's Daddy he's saying P U it smells
# see
# and look a buffalo
# yeah
# &-um cause it's too hot
# look there's the basket for the hot air balloon see
# right I think cause
# yeah I think
# oh hot springs you can but those are all like a hundred and five to a hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit
# and I think &-um like when we went to Yellowstone they said someone actually some kid wandered off into Old Faithful or something and it set off
# yeah
# see look here's the hot air balloon and they're gonna blow it up
# there's the fire
# and they're gonna blow up the balloon see the fire's going straight into the balloon
# and that's what it looks like when we were inside the basket
# and they blew up two big balloons
# and then this is us from the sky we were in the basket and that was the other balloon down below
# so Idaho not so exciting
# I mean
# exactly
# so there we were
# in the basket
# neat huh
# that was before you were born
# back in the days when Mommy and Daddy used to do stuff
# now we play with you
# little yogurt nose
# you're gettin yogurt all over you

# I know you do Honey
# that's fine
# or do you wanna do one like this
# where we dunk them in chocolate
# let's find those
# do you want like this kind where we dunk them in chocolate
# or we could also do
# this kind where we fill them with chocolate
# or we could do chocolate hearts with vanilla frosting
# vanilla hearts with chocolate frosting
# or we could do this kind of hearts dunked in chocolate
# what are you moanin about
# okay well what kind would you like
# that is a heart
# yeah but don't you see that that's a heart shape right there
# you wanna start to make them now
# okay well first we have_to decide which cookies we're making and then we can start &
# okay do you wanna make this kind
# this one we can make we can use our heart cookie cutter for this one if you want
# can roll out the dough and cut hearts out with our cookie cutter and then put chocolate frosting in between them would you like to do that
# yeah we hafta make the dough and this one we roll the dough out
# you can still taste the dough
# Babes
# you know what
# this is no reason to crack up
# cause we're making cookies and that's fun
# or we could do this type of cookie
# we could do this kind of chocolate cookie with chocolate and raisins in them
# you don't like raisins in your cookies
# no
# you have something in common with Daddy he doesn't like raisins in his cookies either
# what do you think of that
# well we could do it with chocolate chips but no raisins
# if you'd prefer you wanna just do chocolate cookies with chocolate chips
# what
# just to eat
# yeah
# well once we make them
# yeah
# yeah
# but you hafta choose what kind you wanna make first
# and I would like you to choose preferably without whining
# okay
# so do you like these kind of sandwich cookies that have frosting in between them or do you just wanna do chocolate cookies like this
# you wanna do chocolate hearts with vanilla frosting
# or would you like to do vanilla hearts with chocolate frosting
# this kind huh
# &-um I'm fine doing either
# they both look good
# well I think I might like these a little bit better with chocolate frosting
# okay why do you ask me if you don't care what I say

# I don't think it's going to
# or do you wanna do these chocolate hearts Babes
# those look pretty don't they
# well we don't have_to put the sugar we can just do the chocolate with no sugar on them
# those are beautiful aren't they
# those are puffy and chocolate and meringuey
# what do you think should we make those beautiful cookies
# yeah
# alright
# let me just see
# sure we can do chocolate with vanilla let's do chocolate with vanilla since that seems to be your preference
# okay
# &-um oh now let me give you fair warning on these though
# for this one you have_to make the dough but then we're gonna hafta cause we hafta roll them out it has to be hard so we hafta put it in the refrigerator and just let it sit so it takes a long time to cook these kinda cookies as opposed to the other kind
# you still wanna make em
# or do you wanna make a quicker cookie
# okay so quicker ones we could either do
# these hearts you definitely want hearts
# yeah
# &-um well but these take a long time to make cause we hafta put them into the refrigerator

# do you mi you don't mind waiting
# a long t
# alright so you pick a cookie out Sweetie
# okay
# it okay
# okay
# it's still gonna take anything that's heart shaped takes a while though to make because we have_to put it in the refrigerator to chill
# &-um let me just see
# I know then how bout we don't make heart shaped cookies cause anything we hafta cut out with cookie cutters
# okay but that's why it takes a long time to make them Baby Cakes
# what about if we do something interesting like this
# chocolate
# I didn't even tell you what we were doing yet
# what if we do chocolate dough with white chocolate chips or something
# like this kinda cookie

# kay
# great who lives in New_York
# well who lives in New_York since we're reading about New_York
# and who else
# &-uh huh
# that's right they all live in New_York
# do you know where Grandma told me that she and Papa were going
# they're going to Greece
# yeah that'd be fun it's very far away
# you wanna go with me one day
# kay they're going to a wedding
# exciting hah
# my name is Becky and I live near the New_York public library
# some buildings in New_York make you feel small
# but walking up the steps of the library makes me feel important
# we should go to the library next time we're in
# wouldn't that be a great idea
# it's like walking up the steps of a palace especially if you walk exactly in the middle
# all the people
# the library was my favorite place in New_York when we first moved here
# my mother painted me a map
# you can see it in the front of this book
# here it is
# she's an artist and she painted all the other pictures too
# she said that once a week we could go wherever I wanted to
# if I could figure out how to get there
# for my first expedition I wanted to see real animals
# finding a zoo on the map was easy
# knowing where I was on the map and which way to walk to the zoo was a little harder
# but I finally figured it out by turning the map
# once the map and I were both facing the same direction finding the zoo was easy
# have you been to the zoo
# yes you have
# one good thing about New_York is that most of the streets are numbered in order
# the numbers go up as you go north and down as you go south
# it's very logical
# so we just walked straight on fifth avenue
# I know I was going the right way because the numbers kept going up
# and at sixty fourth street we turned left
# sometimes zoos make you feel sorry for the animals that live in them but at this one most of the animals aren't in cages
# the penguins have rocks to climb on and make their nests with and a pool to swim in
# you can stand right next to the glass and see under the water
# they were my favorites but I also liked watching the insects
# I saw a leaf cutter ant bite off a leaf and carry it all the way back to its nest
# what was your favorite thing at the zoo do you remember
# yeah do you remember the polar bears
# wasn't there a polar bear named Lily
# that's pretty neat huh
# yeah
# tell me if you want me to take your plate okay
# do you want me to take it
# no
# yes
# I'm just gonna put it over here okay
# while I take a sip of my coffee
# wow what's this
# a ferris wheel
# oh a carousel yes it's true
# after the zoo we explored the park and found a carousel
# I chose a big black horse with a lion saddle
# it wasn't like riding a real horse but it was kind of fun anyway
# the horse went up and down when the music started
# I had three rides
# when I bought my last ticket the man told me that my horse's name was Bubbles
# I thought that was a silly name for a big black horse with a roaring lion saddle
# hm hm
# when I wanted to get a birthday present for my friend Martin my parents said they were going to the twenty sixth street antiques fair and that I could look for one there
# they had a lot of antique toys like a china dog and a wooden horse but I didn't think Martin would really like those
# I did find him some old baseball cards for his collection though
# Mommy used to work right around here
# it's true
# yeah the twenties
# on Martin's birthday I invited him to come with me on an expedition
# first we went to Di Yauto's for cheesecake his favorite dessert
# who loves cheesecake
# I do love cheesecake hm hm
# my mother said they had the best cheesecake in New_York
# Mario Yauto has owned the bakery for fifty years and his baby picture is still on the boxes
# his grandchildren work there in little aprons
# dogs were everywhere because a fancy dog show was going on across the street
# I like the dobermans and a little black bulldog
# there's the dobermans and there's the little black bulldog I guess
# oh I think that is a cat
# where's the little black bulldog I wonder
# have you and Daddy already discussed this
# no
# that one's not a bulldog you're right
# thanks for setting me straight on that one Sweetie
# yeah
# yes Honey
# you want some more strawberries
# should I get them now or should I read some more first
# read some more first
# okay
# do you know what this is
# is it a big boat
# what's it called
# after cheesecake we went to the Intrepid
# a real aircaft &
# you can see where kamikaze planes crashed into it
# yikes
# the fighter jets are real too you can climb up platforms and look inside them
# it was a very cold windy day and we had the whole huge deck almost to ourselves
# Martin ran around acting and sounding like a plane until other people came out so then we went inside
# we got_to work the controls in the simulated cockpit with pilot and copilot seats
# and Martin loved it
# &-uh
# woo
# look at that do you remember what the name of that building is
# that's the Empire state building
# the next week we went to the observation deck of the Empire state building
# we stepped onto it just at that magical moment when the city and bridge lights are on but the sky still has some of the sunset in it and it's not quite dark
# you could see so far
# in the painting we are looking north with the Hudson river on our left and the East river on our right
# the small green square in the distance is Central park
# here we go wow
# ah look there's Central park
# yup
# mhm
# that's the Hudson river and the East river
# some birds flying
# Martin's mother was curious about these expeditions of ours so for our next one we went to Wall street where she works
# we met her on the spot where George Washington was sworn in as our first president
# do you remember where you saw a thing about George Washington
# Liberty's kids right
# do you know who used to work right around Wall street
# actually who used to work on Wall street
# that's right Daddy used to work on Wall street
# mhm it's true
# your daddy
# in the federal hall national memorial museum behind the statue I learned
# mhm
# you want more strawberries now

# they have more stuffed animals than I'd ever seen in my life
# and they really are as big as my mother has painted them
# she let Martin and me paint ourselves into this picture
# can you tell which are our self portraits
# let's see
# there they are
# that's terrific
# hm hm hm
# wow that's great
# I believe so I think you're right
# or the oh you know what I think wait I think I found them
# I think that's the picture of her that her mommy painted but look
# that looks like a kid drew it don't you think
# yeah hehheh
# that's funny
# I said I thought they should have toys designed by children so she let me paint those in too
# guess which toys I made up
# the answer's at the end of the book
# let's see
# hm
# where
# let's see oh here we go
# the toys that Becky drew are called duckie designs because her parents used to call her Ducky
# heh heh here they are
# that's funny
# okay
# on the fourth of July we went to the harbor
# we saw buildings from before the revolution and a little lighthouse memorial to the Titanic
# it has a ball on top that drops down exactly at noon
# sailors used to set their clocks by it
# then we took a boat to the statue of liberty
# we stopped at Ellis island where immigrants used to land when they came to the new
# you did where did you see it
# you and Daddy saw it
# when you went on the Staten island ferry
# on that big boat
# how special huh

# he said if we stood in opposite corners and whispered into them we'd be able to hear each other perfectly but no one else could
# so of course we wanted to try it
# the picture shows us running to grand central
# behind us my mother is talking about the Chrysler building
# it's my favorite building in New_York it's so beautiful look she was taying to us

# my mother ga got me a postcard that tells what all the parts of a dinosaur's names mean

# the sign explained how horses evolved eh and said they've changed much less than many other mammals
# when we were done we decided to have a snack in the plaza on our way to the rose center
# mm
# the lights at the bottom of the plaza's fountain are arranged like the stars in Orion
# real astronomers work here and everything is about space
# the huge sphere represents the

# the bottom one is the big bang the bottom theater is the big bang theater

# but I like the sacred animals and the little charms like the turquoise hippopotamus what's his name
# William
# who has a collection of little Williams
# that's right
# the turquoise hippo that protected a person in his next life from being attacked by real hippos
# they have lots_of other things in the Met it's huge but my mother believes that you enjoy museums more if you don't try to see too much on one visit
# the next week we took the subway up a hundred and twenty fifth street in Harlem
# someone was selling little sweet potato pies right on the sidewalk and we each got one
# yummy Mommy wants a sweet potato pie

# I liked the African prints because of the colors and I liked the smell of the incense burning
# that's an elm tree that once grew in front of an old theater
# people hoping to work in show business business used to touch it for good luck
# when the city chopped down the tree the owners of the Apollo theater bought the biggest slab and put it on a pillar in front of the stage
# on amateur night people touch it for luck before they perform
# it's completely smooth from so many people touching it over the years
# wow that's neat
# I guess that's a different tree
# oh it is that one
# mm
# during school there was less time for expeditions and I didn't go on another one until Halloween
