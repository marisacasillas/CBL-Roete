# I had a nice weekend
# 0i didn't do anything all that exciting
# just visit the library
# that's exciting
# I had a quiet
# Mommy's microphone
# play
# kay ooh clunk
# ooh clunk
# kay
# there you are
# there you are
# okay
# it's  today is June twenty June twenty fifth
# everybody's on
# that's making a good noise
# and I'm gonna test the microphone by clicking the
# c_d player controls
# could hear those very well if this is working
# Naima
# hm see how do I test hers
# do you wanna put on the c_d player
# can you put it on
# no
# okay
# let's see we gotta give her
# play baby
# Mommy will play with you I just wanna get you some crunchy food
# can you come here for a second
# oh that's a bowl
# would you like a crunchy piece of wheat
# no
# shoulda heard that pretty loud if hers is working
# mm kay
# mm
# boy that's stale
# yuck
# mm kay
# okay
# I am testing f one
# if it's working
# you should be able to hear this very clearly
# that was the
# okay I'm gonna shut f one off
# no I'm not I'm gonna leave it on
# turn on f two
# this is a test of the
# I'm close
# I can't play right now because I'm figuring out this equipment
# you've got a nice cup though
# so I'm
# bledder bledder is right
# so I've got it on f one
# I'll try it on f two later
# on the receiver of f one and f two are
# but there is no
# I do not have the transmitter for f two on
# and I'm close to the camera now so I'm gonna walk outside
# this transmitter is working
# cause I'm gonna be talking constantly
# right here
# well and you definitely would not hear me without the microphone here
# so this transmitter itself is not the problem
# if this sound is working
# okay
# and replay that
# okay
# on the receiver
# the f two switch is on off
# rather than on on
# and the other transmitter is still also off so
# you shouldn't be able to hear me
# if I
# if you can hear me now then
# look there's
# hi
# hi
# you gonna open the door for her
# good job
# thank you
# how are you today
# you
# okay tha
# okay this is a test of
# the transmitter which is on f one right now
# and you definitely should not be able to hear this if there's a problem
# now this should be fine cause I just tested it
# this is the one that I thought was not working because it had a new battery
# but I did just change the battery so it has a second new battery which may have been the problem
# and if you can hear this it's definitely fine
# kay now I'm coming back to the camera
# I was in the other room
# and now I put on the one that's on f two
# and walk into the other room
# what is
# if I jiggle the camera a little
# the green lights are on
# okay
# the green lights are now on the receiver
# they were kind of jiggling
# &-um off and on to red
# which is bizarre in and of itself
# it may be a separate problem
# and now with this transmitter on f two
# I'm going to walk away
# and if you can't hear this
# at the same volume right now then
# receiver is not functioning properly
# right
# okay stop
# okay a double test of the hypothesis that the f two channel on the receiver is the malfunction
# I've just switched transmitters
# the one I have I'm putting onto f two
# both green lights on the receiver are on
# they're on green
# and I'm walking into the other room speaking at the same tone of voice
# and you shouldn't be able you should be able to
# sounds like I'm getting louder and louder now then the hypothesis is correct
# okay
# let's find your back
# where is the back
# where's your back
# where
# where
# I don't see it
# I don't see your back

# mostly you
# &-um Mommy carry you she'll say that

# because it's the fall and we started new activities like music class and new music class with new kids in it
# we've only been to that twice
