# one winter morning Peter woke up and looked out the window
# snow had fallen during the night
# it covered everything as far as he could see
# after breakfast he put on his snow
# the snow was piled up very high along the street to make a path for walking
# crunch crunch crunch
# his feet sank into the snow
# he walked with his toes pointing out like this
# that's right
# he walked with his toes pointing in like that
# he dragged his feet slowly to make tracks
# and he found something sticking out of the snow that made a new track
# what was it Ethan
# it was a
# stick
# a stick that was just right for smacking a snow covered tree
# then what happened Ethan
# down fell the snow
# plop
# on top of Peter's head
# he thought it would be fun to join the big boys in their snowball fight but he knew he wasn't old enough
# not yet
# so he made a smiling
# what's that
# snowman and he made
# what are those
# angels right
# he pretended he was a
# a mess maker
# no a mountain climber
# he climbed up a great big heaping mountain of snow and slid whoops
# all the way down
# he picked up a handful of snow and another and still another
# he packed it round and firm and put the snowball in his pocket for tomorrow
# then he went into his warm house
# he told his mommy all about his adventures while she took off his wet socks
# and he thought and thought and thought about it
# what's he doing
# before he got into bed he looked in his pocket
# his pocket was empty
# the snowball wasn't there
# he felt very sad
# while he slept he dreamt that the snow had melted all
# sun had melted all the snow away
# but when he woke up his dream was gone
# the snow was still falling everywhere
# new snow was falling
# after breakfast he called to his friend from across the hall and they went out together into the deep deep snow

# dyou remember
# he found a button
# and he pulled it off
# there he is there's a picture of him
# right
# what's he doing
# he lost his button yeah
# Corduroy is a bear
# who once lived in the toy department of a big store
# day after day he waited with all the other animals and dolls for somebody to come along and take him home
# what's there there's a giraffe and a doll
# bunny
# what's that
# yeah it's a clown
# the store was always full of shoppers buying all sort of things
# but noone ever seemed to want a small bear in green overalls
# then one morning a little girl stopped and looked straight into Corduroy's bright eyes
# oh mommy she said look
# there's the very bear I've always wanted
# not today dear her mother sighed
# I've spent too much already
# besides he doesn't look new
# he's lost the button to his overalls
# Corduroy watched them sadly as they walked away
# I didn't know I'd lost a button he said to himself
# tonight I'll go and see if I can find it
# what did he do
# late that evening when all the shoppers had gone and the doors were shut and locked Corduroy climbed carefully down from his shelf and began searching everywhere on the floor for his lost button
# uhoh what's that Ethan
# an escalator
# suddenly he felt the floor moving under him
# quite by accident he had stepped on an escalator and up he went
# could this be a mountain he wondered
# I think I've always wanted to climb a mountain
# is it a mountain Ethan
# no what is it
# yeah it's the escalator
# he stepped off the escalator as it reached the next floor
# and there before his eyes was a most amazing sight
# tables and chairs and lamps and sofas
# and rows and rows of
# beds
# this must be a palace Corduroy gasped
# I guess I've always wanted to live in a palace
# he wandered around admiring the furniture
# Bob wants to read the story
# this must be a bed he said
# I've always wanted to sleep in a bed
# and up he crawled onto the large thick mattress
# all at once he saw something small and round
# what did he think it was
# hm
# what did he think it was
# why there's my button he cried and he tried to pick it up
# but like all the other buttons
# on the mattress it was tied down tight
# and then what happened Ethan
# he yanked and pulled with both paws until
# pop
# off came the button and off the mattress Corduroy toppled
# bang into a lamp
# over it fell with a crash
# yep there's Corduroy
# Corduroy didn't know it but there was someone else awake in the store
# the night watchman was going on his rounds on the floor above
# when he heard the crash he came dashing down the escalator
# now who in the world did that he said
# somebody must be hiding around here
# he flashed his light around sofas and beds until he came to the biggest bed of all
# and there he saw two fuzzy brown ears sticking out from under the cover
# who was it
# who's that hiding
# Corduroy
# hello he said
# how did you get upstairs
# and the watchman tucked Corduroy under his arm and carried him down the escalator
# and put him on a shelf in the toy department with all the other animals and dolls
# what are they doing Ethan
# they're sleeping that's right
# Corduroy was just waking up when the first customers came into the store in the morning
# there looking at him with a wide warm smile was the same girl
# he'd seen only the day before
# I'm Lisa she said and you're going to be my very own bear
# last night I counted
# mhm
# I counted what I saved in my piggy
# do you have a piggy
# yup it's upstairs
# that's right
# and it has lots_of money in it
# and my mother said I could bring you home
# shall I put him in a box for you the sales lady asked
# no thank you
# no thank you said Lisa
# and she carried Corduroy home in her arms
# she ran all the way up four flights of stairs into her family's apartment and straight into her own room
# Corduroy blinked
# there was a chair
# an a dresser
# and next to a girl sized bed
# what was next to a girl sized bed
# yep that's right a little bed just for him
# yup for me
# this must be home he said
# I know I've always wanted a home
# Lisa sat down with Corduroy on her lap and began to sew a button on his overalls
# I like you the way you are she said
# but you'll be more comfortable with your shoulder strap fastened
# you must be a friend said Corduroy

# this is the life for me
# he keeps going
# all that day Scuffy sailed along with the stream
# past cows and women washing clothes
# Scuffy almost got hit by a cow
# that was not fun
# night came and the moon came out
# there was nothing to see but the quiet trees
# suddenly an owl called out
# hoot hoot
# toot toot
# cried the little tugboat
# he was scared
# he wanted to see the man with the polka
# the next morning Scuffy moved on
# he saw two streams
# to make a big river
# Scuffy sailed down the river
# he sailed past villages
# he sailed past men with logs
# what're they doing Ethan
# they're gonna get the logs ready for the logging truck
# this is a fine river said Scuffy but it's very busy and big for me
# he sailed under some bridges
# the river got deeper and wider and now there were big cities
# and big boats
# the river got deeper and deeper and deeper and it moved faster and faster
# then it started to rain and Scuffy was riding on the waves
# up and down
# lots and lots and lots_of rain
# people had to bring cranes and put sand bags by the river
# cause the river was getting bigger and bigger and bigger and higher and higher and higher
# and there's Scuffy all alone
# on went the river to the sea
# at last Scuffy sailed into a big city
# here the river got wider and there were docks and wharves and big ships
# it was a big noisy place
# and cranes loaded freight onto some ships
# Scuffy said toot toot
# but nobody saw him the little tugboat
# oh no said Scuffy when he saw the great big ocean
# there's no beginning and no end to the sea
# I wish I could find the man with the polka
# yup there's a red truck and what's that
# yep it goes all the way to the dock
# just then just as the little red tugboat sailed past the last piece of land a hand reached out
# mm there's a lot of smoke coming out of those ships isn't there
# that's Scuffy again
# he's all by himself
# but look who picked him up

# he went into his house and put on his father's old hat
# to make himself feel more grown up
# he looked in then to the mirror to practice whistling
# still no whistle
# when his mother saw what he was doing
# Peter pretended that he was his father
# he said I've come home early today dear is Peter here
# his mother answered
# why no he's outside with Willie

# 0have to push it down a little huh
# there ya go
# what's Toby doing
# chugging along happily
# sometimes Thomas pulled his coaches Annie and Clarabelle
# hurry hurry said the coaches
# sometimes Thomas pulled freight cars
# faster faster said the foolish freight cars
# they would try to push Thomas down the hill
# and sometimes Thomas traveled all by
# hm
# is the what
# sometimes Thomas traveled all by himself across the island
# he chugged in the rain
# he huffed in the sun
# and he puffed in the snow
# there is nothing a train cannot do Thomas said proudly
# one morning Henry the
# he had
# he had
# boiler ache yep
# so Sir Topham Hat asked Thomas to help
# peep peep Thomas said to the people
# I can take you where you want to go
# soon clouds gathered
# the sky grew dark
# thunder rumbled
# plip plop clunk
# hail began to fall
# it fell on Thomas
# it fell on the tracks
# suddenly Thomas's driver saw trouble ahead
# slow down
# said the driver
# the hail had made a crack
# Thomas came to a stop
# his driver called out
# we cannot go forward and
# we can't go back
# we must not go back
# there's the crack
# everyone off the conductor said
# now what shall we do
# said the people
# they climbed down from the coaches and climbed up to the road
# Bertie the bus was just passing by
# Bertie beeped his horn merrily
# a bus is as good as a train he said
# I can take you where you want to go
# hm
# all the people climbed on board Bertie
# Bertie scooted down the road
# a bus is as good as a train the people said
# suddenly Bertie's driver saw trouble ahead
# slow down
# the driver said
# why did they have_to slow down
# hm
# do you remember
# why did they have_to slow down Ethan
# why
# why
# why
# dere in the road was a bright green toad
# Bertie came to a stop
# his driver called out there's a toad in the road we'll have_to unload
# everyone off said Bertie's driver
# that toad in the road caused a fuss on the bus
# what will happen to us
# the people said
# then they walked down the road to another train station
# but the trains were not running
# why not
# said the people
# they soon found out
# what does that say
# no trains yep
# Thomas was still stuck at the crack in the track
# Percy was stuck there at Thomas's
# Gordon was stuck
# James with two freight cars was quite in a hurry
# there's Gordon yep
# mm that's right James behind Gordon
# the freight cars were needed in the yard
# but James could not get past Gordon and Percy and Thomas
# and the foolish freight cars refused to back up
# no no no they said
# we
# ow
# will not go they said
# they're pretty silly huh
# so no train could move up
# and no trains could move back
# they were stuck where they were at that
# at that
# at that
# at this
# at that
# crack in the track
# mm they were stuck where they were at the crack in track
# it rhymes
# I guess there are some things a train cannot do said Thomas's driver
# we need help said Thomas
# and I know just who to call
# who are they gonna call
# who
# who are they gonna call
# t's a little more left huh
# Thomas's driver called Sir Topham Hat
# and told him Thomas's plan
# an excellent plan Sir Topham Hat said
# please thank Thomas he added
# in no time at all
# in no time at all Harold the helicopter zoomed across the sky
# he landed near the people
# they all climbed aboard
# a helicopter as good as
# is as good as a train said Harold
# I can take you where you want to go
# the breakdown crew came
# they had to replace the broken track
# by the time they arrived rain was falling hard
# the crew came with cranes
# they sang while they worked
# a crane is as good as a bus or a train
# we'll fix up your track and we
# don't mind the rain hm
# finally Thomas could move
# so could Percy and Gordon
# yep there's Cranky
# James with his freight cars was close behind
# they turned on the turntable and went back to work
# there is Cranky
# the people saw Thomas waiting to take them home
# are you sure you can take us where we want to go
# they asked
# I thought there was nothing a train could not do said Thomas

# what does it say on the box
# you were saying it yesterday
# what did the box say
# urgent
# urgent means important that's right
# Cranky was unloading a box for Sir Topham Hatt
# the box was marked urgent
# humph creaked Cranky what's so urgent about this package
# Thomas heard Cranky's question
# if it says urgent we should get it to Sir Topham Hatt as fast as we can he said
# I'll take it
# just then Gordon pulled up next to Thomas
# an urgent package needs a speedy train said Gordon I'm
# yup he doesn't have it any more
# where is it
# it must be on the docks here
# I'm the fastest train here so I will have_to take the package
# Gordon took the package and set off immediately
# Thomas was left behind
# I could have gotten it there quickly he peeped
# Gordon hurried down the track and took a hilly shortcut
# suddenly he saw a red signal
# some rocks had fallen across his path
# he was stuck
# just then Toby came by on an open truck
# help said Gordon
# I have an urgent package for Sir Topham Hatt
# I'll take it down the hill said Toby
# thank you
# Gordon called as Toby chugged away
# Toby clickety_clacked quickly down the hill
# what's that
# what's that Ethan
# a waterfall like we saw yesterday yeah
# Percy was waiting at the bottom
# thank you for bringing the urgent package down said Percy
# now I can take it to Sir Topham Hatt
# Sir Topham Hatt will be very proud of me Percy tooted as he hurried along
# toot toot no he doesn't say toot he says peep
# Percy rounded a bend and saw James ahead of him pulling two troublesome trucks
# yep they're in the way
# James was going very slowly because the trucks had their brakes on
# they were trying to stop James
# we want to take the package said the troublesome trucks
# we won't release our brakes until you give it to us
# they wouldn't go until they took the package
# Percy was very mad
# but he knew that the urgent package had to get to Sir Topham Hatt quickly
# with a sigh he gave it to the trucks
# no more trouble from you trucks said James
# the trucks released their brakes
# James and the trucks quickly left Percy behind
# was Thomas listening to the story too
# James was glad he would be the one to deliver this urgent package now
# James was going so fast he almost didn't see
# what is it Ethan
# the broken track right
# the broken track
# oh no wailed James
# now Sir Topham Hatt will never get his urgent package
# I'll take the urgent package said Harold landing next to James
# he took the package and flew off
# Harold soared over the countryside
# he looked down and saw Thomas pulling in into Tidmouth station
# Thomas had been faster than Gordon after all
# where's my package Sir Topham Hatt said
# just then Harold landed
# I have it sir he said
# and he told Thomas and Sir Topham Hatt what happened
# finally Sir Topham Hatt opened the urgent package
# what could be inside
# a new hat right
# it's a shiny new hat
# just in time for tonight's big party Sir Topham Hatt said putting the hat on his head
# and Thomas next time there is an urgent package
# I want you to bring it
# which one
# Thomas the tank engine rolling along
# that one
# he is the one he is the one
# one more song there is another one
# what is it
# Thomas we love you
# yep
# we know a couple train songs
# I'm a little choo
# now I'm going forward now I'm going back
# and then we know engine engine number nine
# going down
# that's Douglas that's right
# or Donald
# Donald is nine I think and Douglas is ten
# engine engine number nine going down Chicago line
# if the train should
# jump the track
# do you want your money back
# will you get your money back
# yes no a maybe so
# yes no a maybe so
# that's just a design
# it's a design an what's that Ethan
# mhm a one [
# an what's this design
# tracks right
# when engineers get hot they use this to wipe their face
# that's why they carry a kerchief
# it's called a kerchief
# it's like a handkerchief
# remember we read about a handkerchief
# I don't know
# it's a  I don't know
# I don't know what it's called it's called a kerchief
# that's right
# an engineers keep it in their pockets
# so they can wipe their faces when it gets hot
# or wipe their
# they get dusty
# cause sometimes you get dusty when you drive a train
# your pants are falling down huh

# Toby and the flood
# it had been raining hard for weeks
# Toby was feeling miserable
# everywhere was
# wet
# wet
# wet
# that's a dam
# an the water's coming through
# it's like a big wall an the water is pouring through
# only the great wall known as a dam was stopping the water from overflowing
# Percy arrived just as Toby was about to expect the dam for any damage
# driver tells me it may be dangerous up there careful Toby
# I'll try said Toby bravely
# Percy watched anxiously as Toby trundled away
# there he goes over that bridge
# his journey took him over a wooden bridge at the edge of the village
# the river surged dangerously beneath it
# the water's getting higher and higher
# the river's getting higher and higher
# just like in the
# just like in that other story
# the &-um what story
# about the tugboat
# Scuffy
# Harold the Helicopter was inspecting the dam as Toby arrived
# be brave Toby called his driver
# we have_to cross to the other side
# the dam did not look safe at all and Toby was worried
# soon he knew why
# it broke
# see the wall broke
# the dam's breaking up
# we must warn everyone
# Toby shunted back as fast as his wheels would let him
# Percy was waiting anxiously for Toby by the bridge
# the river had risen so high that the bridge was in danger of collapsing
# the dam's breaking up we must find high ground
# shouted Toby's driver
# your only chance is to cross the bridge called Toby
# called Percy
# it doesn't look safe to me wailed Toby
# yeah
# Thomas look at it break up like that an the water's rushing through
# it's our only chance said his driver
# if the dam breaks we'll be
# we'll be
# done for yep
# Toby was halfway across when disaster struck
# help called Toby
# we'll follow him on our line
# it meets the river further down
# as Toby floated helplessly in the flood waters they passed a sign that made them shudder
# what does it say
# beware the waterfall that's right
# if we go over that waterfall we're
# doomed
# then they saw Harold who slooped
# swooped
# you wanna lie down
# okay
# you're a tired little pumpkin today huh
# let's see
# we're gonna drop a rope to you
# attach it to yourself
# quickly now
# and they did
# to one of Toby's buffers
# just then Percy arrived
# Harold flew over to him
# catch the rope and pull Toby to safety
# he called
# Toby was safe at last
# see
# Percy's pulling Toby
# an he's attached to a rope
# oof
# when the floods were over and the dam mended the villagers had a big party for Toby hosted by Sir Topham Hatt
# you were very brave Toby
# thanks to Harold
# I never could've been so brave Toby said Percy
# oh I'm sure you would be
# but you never know til you've tried
# Percy rather hoped he would never have_to
# what story's this
# a better view for Gordon that's right
# Gordon was feeling grumpy
# this was making James cross
# why are you complaining all the time
# because I'm a big engine and I know everything
# I shall complain whenever I want
# you're just a small engine with ideas above your station
# I can't see any said Percy where are they
# any what
# ideas above the station
# the sky's empty
# like your smoke
# laughed James
# but Gordon was still grumpy
# one day I'll show you just what a big engine can really do
# not speak to silly little green
# so what can a big engine really do
# not speak to silly little green engines for a start replied Gordon
# then he puffed away
# later that day Sir Topham Hatt came to see him
# Gordon you'll be making one stop today with an empty express to test our new station
# you can make up time afterwards
# why can't Henry do it
# he likes idling in stations
# you will do as you are told
# so Gordon did but he was still unhappy
# an he grew sick too
# Gordon was sick
# mm can you see his face
# there it is
# he's making a funny face
# mm
# I can't do it
# do I look like Gordon
# you look funny too
# I just can't get up to speed he moaned
# it's time for your visit to the works
# he moaned and he groaned
# your pipes are clogged said the fireman
# at last they approached the new station
# Gordon was impressed but his mood soon changed
# in front of him was a blank wall an huge buffers
# what a boring view
# important engines like me should have a panoramic view where I can see people and people can see me
# and he weeshed angrily
# weesh
# weesh
# Gordon was happy when it was time to leave
# now you can really enjoy your run as long as your pipes will let you said his driver
# come on come on I can go faster than this puffed Gordon
# sick
# me
# never
# but Gordon began to feel more and more feeble
# that means weak
# soon he came to a complete stop
# what happened
# his driver and his fireman inspected him
# something's broken inside you said the fireman
# now you really will have_to go to the works
# Gordon was still angry when James arrived to collect his cookies
# well well well
# so much for knowing about everything
# you got too puffed up in your boiler so it serves you right
# serves you right serves you right
# when Gordon returned from the works a few days later he was still boasting
# I am the finest engine on the island of Sodor
# probably the finest in the world
# come on Gordon we're going to the new official opening of the station
# then there was trouble
# as Gordon approached the station
# neither the fire
# driver or the fireman could apply his brakes
# something had jammed
# the driver reduced steam but Gordon was still going too fast
# help me please
# he pleaded to him
# well Gordon said Sir Topham Hatt I knew you wanted a panoramic view but this is not the way to achieve it
# what did Gordon say
# yes so sorry sir
# yes so sorry sir
# when Gordon was repaired again he took Sir Topham Hatt to the new station for its second official opening
# this time he arrived safely an everyone clapped and cheered as he pulled in

# sit next to me
# yep
# you want your bottle
# where did I put it
# oh I put it up here
# you're sleepy huh
# I have my drink
# you have your drink
# Harold and the purple crayon
# one evening
# after thinking it over for some time
# Harold decided to go for a walk in the
# moonlight
# there wasn't any moon
# and Harold
# needed a moon oh
# needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight
# and he needed something to walk on
# he made a long straight path so he wouldn't get lost
# and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him
# there it is
# but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path
# so he left the path for a shortcut across a field
# and the moon went with him
# the shortcut led right to where Harold thought a forest ought_to be
# he didn't want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest with
# just one tree in it
# that's right
# it turned out to be an
# yep
# the apples would be very tasty Harold thought when they got red
# so he put a
# yep a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples
# it was a terrible frightening dragon
# it even frightened Harold he backed away
# his hand holding the purple crayon
# shook
# yep
# suddenly he realized
# that's right your hands are shaking
# that's right he's falling right into the water
# by then Harold was over his head
# in an ocean hm
# mhm
# just like you were in the ocean the other day
# he came up thinking fast
# and
# thinking fast and thinking big heh
# he's thinking a lot yep
# he has to think a lot cause he has a lot of adventures so he has to
# he has to
# protect himself
# and in no time at all he was climbing aboard a
# a trim little boat
# he quickly set sail
# and the moon sailed along with him
# mhm
# and what did he draw
# mhm
# the sailboat
# after he had sailed long enough Harold made land without much trouble
# he stepped ashore on the beach
# mhm
# wondering where he was
# where was he
# right
# the sandy beach reminded Harold of
# yep picnics
# and the thought of picnics made him hungry so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch what was his lunch
# yep lots_of pies
# there was nothing but pie
# but they were all nine kinds of pie that Harold liked best
# when Harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left
# he hated so to see so much pie go to waste so Harold left
# mhm and a
# yep the moose is gonna eat the pie up and what is the other animal he left
# a porcupine a deserving porcupine to finish it up
# and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was
# mhm a moose and a porcupine they're gonna finish up all the pie
# Harold knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see
# so he decided to make the hill into a
# yep mountain
# if he went high enough he thought he could see the window of his bedroom
# he was tired and he felt he ought_to be getting to bed
# he hoped he could see his bedroom window from the top of the mountain
# but what happened
# as he looked down over the other side he
# yep he slipped
# and there wasn't any other side of the mountain he was falling in
# thin air but luckily
# right he kept his wits and his purple crayon
# he made a balloon and he grabbed on to it
# and he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in
# he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn't see his window
# no I can see your window right over there right over there too
# you have two windows in your bedroom
# and usually the moon is
# we can see the moon out that window
# at night
# he couldn't even see a house
# so he made a house
# with windows
# two houses yup
# and he landed the balloon on the grass in the front
# looks like your house
# none of the windows was his window
# he tried to think where his window ought_to be
# he made some more windows
# he made a big building full of windows
# he made lots_of buildings full of windows
# he made a whole city full of windows
# it does look like New York City and there's the moon it's still there
# but none of the windows was his window
# he couldn't think where it might be
# yep
# that's right
# he decided to ask a policeman
# the policeman pointed the way Harold was going anyway
# but Harold thanked him
# he followed the way
# as he walked a
# and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in bed
# you gonna walk straight to your bed
# then suddenly Harold remembered
# he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon
# going to your bed
# just like Harold did
# the purple and brown book that's what color it is
# mixed up
# like your color and like your eyes are a little bit blue
# and a little bit green
# now this book is a lot brown and some purple
# a different color purple
# that's a color purple and that's a different color purple
# he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon it was always right around the moon
# that's right
# we're both wearing stripes Ethan
# my shirt is stripy and your shirt is stripy
# you wanna mix our shirts together
# mix mix mix mix mix
# and then we would have a new stripy shirt
# and then Harold made his bed
# he got in it
# and he drew up the covers
# the purple crayon dropped on the floor and Harold dropped off to sleep
# year after year after year after year
# ear after ear and year after year
# oh here's my ponytail holder
# did you like it when I have a ponytail
# you'd
# I thought you didn't like it
# okay
