# I will never ever not eat a tomato
# I have this lil sister Lola
# she is small and very funny
# sometimes I have_to keep an eye on her and sometimes I have_to give her dinner
# this is difficult because Lola is a very fussy eater
# Lola won't eat carrots of course
# she says carrots are for rabbits
# I say what about peas
# Lola says peas are too small and too green
# one day I played a good trick on her
# yeah
# Lola was sitting at the table waiting for her dinner
# those are oranges
# and I said
# and she said I do not eat peas or carrots or potatoes
# or mushrooms or spaghetti
# or eggs or sausages
# I do not eat cauliflower cabbage or baked beans
# or bananas or oranges
# and I'm not fond of apples rice cheese or fish sticks
# and I absolutely will never not ever eat tomatoes
# my sister hates tomatoes
# and I said this is lucky because we are not going to be having any of those things
# we are not going to eat any peas or carrots or potatoes or mushrooms or spaghetti eggs or sausages
# that's Charlie
# there will be no cauliflower cabbage baked beans bananas or oranges
# and we don't have any apples rice cheese or fish sticks
# and certainly no tomatoes
# Lola looked at the table
# then why are these carrots there Charlie
# I don't ever eat carrots
# and I said oh you think they're carrots but they're not these are orange Twiglets from Jupiter
# what's that
# does that look like the moon to you
# yeah that's Saturn
# that's a planet
# they look just like carrots to me said Lola
# that's a star
# like I wonder if they're confused
# cause it's not a star shape
# ya know
# there's Lola and she's sitting with a green alien
# from Jupiter
# I think
# yeah
# and there's Charlie he's in a spaceship
# how can they be carrots I said
# carrots don't grow in Jupiter
# that's true said Lola
# I might just try one
# if they came all the way from Jupiter
# not bad she said
# and took another bite
# then Lola saw some peas I don't eat peas said Lola
# I said these are not peas of course they're not these are green drops from Greenland
# they're made out of green and they fall from the sky
# but I don't eat green things Lola said
# oh goody then I'll have your share green drops are so incredibly rare
# that's Charlie
# maybe I'll just nibble on one or two she said
# quite tasty
# next Lola saw the potato
# next Lola saw the potato I will not eat potatoes so don't even try not even mashed
# that's a big potato
# oh this isn't mashed potato people often think it is but it's cloud fluff
# cloud fluff from the pointiest peak on Mount Fugi
# oh she said in that case a large helping for me please I love to eat cloud
# that's a mountain
# Mount Fugi
# the Fugi mountain
# that's one tall mountain
# oh

# and I couldn't believe my eyes cause she was pointing at the tomatoes
# that's Charlie

# but at least that takes like half and hour to eat
# as opposed to like
# oh I think you have_to turn it on first honey
# you wanna press the buttons
# you can press this button to
# this is a fit waiting to happen
# she's trying to get that cash draw open
# she's definitely entered the cranky stage cause
# if she finds a toy that frustrates her she picks and and throws it
# she's actually got all her teeth
# she got them all really early
# she hasn't gotten a tooth in gosh I think she got all her teeth my the time she was a year old
# except for her two year molars
# I can't tell whether I've been sticking my fingers in her mouth
# it's hard to get back so far to see if they're coming in
# they're not suppose to come for I guess until she's about two but she got her teeth so early that I'd be surprised if she didn't get these early to
# she got her first two bottom teeth in when she was just three and a half months old

# a green tie right

# instead of greetings students or good morning pupils Mister Slinger winked and said howdy
# he thought desks in rows were old fashioned and boring
# do you rodents thinks you think you can handle a semicircle
# and he was always providing them with tasty snacks
# things that were curly and crunchy and cheesy
# I wanna be a teacher when I grow up said Lilly
# me too said her friends Chester and Wilson and Victor
# at home Lily pretended to be Mister Slinger
# I am the teacher she told her baby brother Julius listen up
# Lilly even wanted her own set of deluxe picture encyclopedias
# whenever the students had free time they were permitted to go to the light bulb lab in the back of the classroom
# they expressed their ideas creatively through drawing and writing
# Lilly went often
# she had a lot of ideas
# she drew pictures of Mister Slinger and wrote stories about him too
# during sharing time Lilly showed her creations to the entire class
# wow said Mister Slinger
# when Mister Slinger had bus duty Lilly stood in line even though she didn't ride the bus
# Lilly raised her hand more than anyone in the class even if she didn't know the answer
# and she volunteered to stay after school to clap erasers
# I wanna be a teacher when I grow up said Lilly
# excellent choice said Mister Slinger
# one Monday morning Lilly came to school especially happy
# she had gone shopping with her Grammy over the weekend
# she had a new pair of movie star sunglasses
# complete with glittery diamonds and a chain like Mister Slinger's
# she had three shiny quarters and best of all she had a brand new purple plastic purse that played a jaunty tune when it was opened
# Lily wanted to show everyone
# not now said Mister Slinger listen to our story
# Lilly had a hard time listening
# she really wanted to show everyone
# what's Mister Slinger doing
# he has a book what's he doing with the book
# really
# Lilly really really wanted to show everyone
# not now said Mister Slinger
# but Lilly couldn't wait
# the glasses were so glittery the quarters were so shiny and the purse played such nice music not to mention how excellent it was for storing school supplies
# look she whispered look everyone look what I've got
# everyone looked including Mister Slinger
# and he was not amused
# I'll just keep your things at my desk until the end of the day he said and then you can take them home
# Lilly's stomach lurched she felt like crying
# that afternoon she went to the light bulb lab she was still very sad
# she thought and thought and thought and then she became angry
# she thought and thought and thought some more and then she became furious and drew a picture of Mister Slinger
# it was not a very nice picture
# right before the last bell rang she sneaked the drawing into Mister Slinger's book bag
# a bag yeah
# you've got a bag too and they're both purple
# oh
# wow that's great
# purple
# yes honey
# yes sweetie
# oh Lilly was very sad and ran all the way home
# she found a nice note from Mister Slinger and some snacks in her bag and she felt very guilty
# so her mother wrote a note and her father made some delicious snacks
# the next morning Lilly got_to school early
# these are for you she said to Mister Slinger because I'm really really really really really really really really really really really really sorry
# really really really really really really really sorry
# no she was just plain sorry
# Mister Slinger read the story and looked at the picture and sampled the snacks
# oh no

# some stars and some swirls too
# you know what honey Mommy's very tired because someone got up at four in the morning

# then she did a little performance using her bag and glasses and props
# it's called an interpretive dance said Lilly
# Mister Slinger joined in
# throughout the rest of the day
# yeah
# her purse and quarters were in her desk
# she looked at them often but did not disturb a soul
# she ran and skipped and hopped and flew all the way home
# she wanted to be a teacher

# sweetie do you wanna read a book
# do you want to read Paddington
# okay let Mommy go get Paddington I think he's in the kitchen
# you're going to find it
# oh here Mommy found it
# find it
# kay
# okay we'll sit down
# and we'll read Paddington
# do you know what this says
# what does that say
# this book belongs to Mommy
# that's right this book belongs to Mommy
# cause it was hers when she was little
# one day Mister and Missus Brown were standing in Paddington station
# they were waiting for their daughter Judy who was coming home from school
# Suddenly Mister Brown noticed something small and furry behind a pile of mail bags
# look over there he said to Missus Brown I'm sure I saw a bear
# a bear said Missus Brown in Paddington station
# don't be silly Henry there can't be
# but there was
# it had a funny kind of a hat and was sitting all by itself on an old suitcase near the lost property office
# oh as they drew near the bear stood up and politely raised its hat
# good afternoon it said in a small clear voice can I help you
# we were wondering if we could help you said Missus Brown wherever have you come from
# the bear looked round carefully before replying
# darkest Peru I stowed away and I lived on marmalade
# Missus bear spotted a label around the bear's neck it said please look after this bear thank you Aunt Lucy
# Missus Brown went off to look for Judy and Mister Brown took Paddington into the cafeteria for something to eat
# he left Paddington sitting at a corner table near the window
# he soon returned carrying two steaming cups of
# tea
# and a large plate piled high with sticky cakes
# after his long journey Paddington was so hungry and thirsty he didn't know which to do first eat or drink
# I think I'll try both at the same time if you don't mind Mister Brown he announced
# and without waiting for a reply he climbed on the table
# Mister Brown stared out of the window pretending that he had tea with a bear at Paddington station every day of his life
# when Missus Brown came into the cafeteria with Judy she threw up her hands in horror
# Henry she said what are you doing to that poor bear he's covered with cream and jam
# at the sound of Missus bear's voice Paddington jumped so much he stepped on a patch of strawberry jam and fell over backwards into his saucer of tea
# oh no
# I think we'd better go before anything else happens said Mister Brown and he quickly led the way out of the cafeteria
# Judy took Paddington's paw and squeezed it
# come along she said we'll take you home in a taxi
# then you can have a nice hot bath and meet my brother Jonathan
# Paddington had never been in a taxi before he found it very exciting
# and he stood on a little tip up seat behind the driver so he could wave to the people in the street
# soon they pulled up outside a large house with a green front door
# when they were indoors Judy took Paddington up to his room to unpack
# he has a picture of Aunt Lucy
# hm
# next she showed Paddington the bathroom
# as soon as he was on his own he turned on the taps and climbed onto the stool in order to look out of the window
# then he tried to write his name on the steamy glass with his paw
# it took him rather a long time and when he looked round he found to his surprise that the bath was so full of water it was starting to run over the side
# uhoh
# uhoh
# he closed his eyes and holding his nose with one paw he jumped in
# the water was hot and soapy and very deep and to his horror he couldn't get out
# he couldn't even turn the taps off
# Paddington tried calling out help at first in a quiet voice so as not to disturb anyone but then much louder help help
# but still nobody came
# then he had an idea
# he took off his hat and began using it to bail out the water
# downstairs Judy was telling her brother all about Paddington
# when suddenly she felt a plop
# looking up she saw a dark wet patch on the ceiling
# Paddington she cried he must be in trouble quick
# and they raced out of the room and up the stairs
# Jonathan and Judy leaned over the side of the bath and lifted a dripping and very frightened Paddington onto the floor
# what a mess said Jonathan we'd better wipe it up pretty quickly
# oh Paddington said Judy what good luck we found you in time you might have drowned
# Paddington sat up what good like I had
# some time later a beautifully clean Paddington came downstairs
# settling himself down in a small armchair by the fire he put his paws behind his head and stretched out his toes
# it was nice being a bear especially a bear called Paddington
# he had a feeling life with the Browns was going to be fun
# that's right Paddington's lying on the chair with the pillows he's relaxing
# ooh he's very comfortable
# shh he's going to sleep shh
# did you wanna go pick out another book honey

# his mother called him wild thing and Max said I'll eat you up
# so he was sent to bed without eating anything
# oh no
# that very night in Max's room a forest grew
# and grew
# and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and his walls became the world all around
# and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max and he sailed off through night and day
# what's he doing
# he's in a boat
# and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are
# wow
# and when he came to the place where the wild things are they roared their terrible roars and they gnashed their terrible teeth and they rolled their terrible eyes and they showed their terrible claws
# do you think they're scary
# do you think they're funny
# till Max said be still
# and tamed them with the magic trick of staring into their yellow eyes without blinking once
# and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all
# and made him king of all wild things
# that's a chicken wild thing
# yes
# bock bock bock bock bock
# do you see any other
# what other animals do you see
# oh yes
# which what animal does this one look like
# he does look like a cow
# you're right
# and now cried Max let the wild rumpus begin
# and they danced by the light of the moon
# and they hung from the trees
# and they had their wild thing parade
# now stop Max said and sent the wild things to bed without their supper
# and Max the king of all wild things was lonely
# and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all
# and all around from far away across the world he smelled good things to eat
# so he gave up being king of where the wild things are
# but the wild things cried oh please don't go we'll eat you up we love you so
# and Max said no
# the wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws
# but Max stepped into his private boat and waved goodbye
# byebye
# and sailed back over a year and in and out of weeks and through a day
# and into the night of his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him

# okay it's right next to Manuela
# can you say thank you
# Frederic
# all along the meadow where the cows grazed and the horses ran there was an old stone wall
# in that wall not far from the barn and the granary a chatty family of field mice had their home
# that's right nuts and wheat
# but the farmers had moved away the barn was abandoned and the granary stood empty
# and since winter was not far off the little mice began to gather corn and nuts and wheat and straw
# and they all worked day and night all except Frederick
# Frederick looks like he's asleep
# Frederick why don't you work they asked
# I do work they're carrying corn
# I gather sun rays for the cold dark winter days
# and when they saw Frederick sitting there staring at the they said
# nuts and wheat
# they said and now Frederick I gather colors answered Frederick simply for winter is gray
# that's right
# and once Frederick seemed half asleep are you dreaming Frederick they asked reproachfully but Frederick said oh no I'm gathering words for the winter days are long and many and we'll run out of things to say
# huh what's coming down
# snow
# the winter days came and when the first snow fell the five little field mice took to their hideout in the stones
# &-um they're eating cookies wow they're lucky
# in the beginning there was lots to eat and the mice told stories of foolish foxes and silly cats and they were a happy family
# they were very happy
# but little by little they had nibbled up most of the nuts and berries the straw was gone and the corn was only a memory
# it was cold in the wall and no one felt like chatting
# and then they remembered what Frederick had said about sun rays and colors and words what about your supplies Frederick
# close your eyes said Frederick as he climbed on a big stone I send you the rays of sun
# do you feel their golden glow and as Frederick spoke of the sun the four little mice began to feel warmer was it Frederick's voice
# was it magic
# and what about the colors Frederick close your eyes again he said and he told them of the blue periwinkles the red poppies and the yellow wheat and the green leaves of the berry bush
# and they saw the colors as clearly if they had been painted in their minds
# and the words Frederick
# Frederick cleared his throat waited a moment and then said as if from a stage aren't we lucky the seasons are four what if there was one less or one more
# why Frederick they said you're a poet Frederick blushed took a bow and said shyly I know it
# I know it
# another book
# you wanna get some from mommy's room I think she's got better books in her room
# no okay
# ah little miss spider

# &-um yeah

# acorn alley
# huh lil miss spider's home she lives in the tree
# should we read it
# little miss spider got ready for school she packed her new notebook her pencils and
# peering outside she sipped tea from her cup and eagerly watched for the sun to come
# up
# she dreamt as she gazed her mind running through the wonderful things she'd learn how to do
# huh wow look at all the things
# she's painting
# she's reading
# she's doing science experiments
# doing math she's adding her numbers she's swinging she's flying she's playing with a ball she's skipping rope and she's learning her alphabet too
# mhm
# sunny patch school was the best place to go to study lessons that all bugs ought_to know
# there were classes and climbing and clinging to walls for hiding in bushes and curling in balls
# she would learn about flowers from petal to root how to chew tasty leaves and tunnel through fruit
# yummy
# she gobbled her breakfast a fresh flower plate and ran the whole way to be first at the gate
# the principal smiled as he pulled back the latch I know you'll be happy at dear sunny patch
# but she found she lacked talent for hiding in trees for chirping like crickets or humming like bees
# she hadn't the strength to drill leaves with her tongue and hardly the stomach for digging in dung
# I am useless at stinging she said with a sigh perhaps I'll be better at learning to fly
# there's little miss spider
# she is sad
# each student was tossed from a leaf of a rose poor little miss spider fell flat on her
# nose
# the school day was over they sounded the bell she sobbed is there anything I can do well
# then she heard a bug cry I'm stuck in a spout and she climbed to the top and hoisted him out
# that's the bug I think he's an ant
# right
# the principal beamed as he watched from afar he lifted miss spider and gave her a
# a star
# our gifts they are many we hop fly and crawl but kindness he said is the finest of all
# huh sunny patch school
# honey hive
# froggy bog and taddy puddle

# Paddington's lucky day
# you know Paddington lives in England
# we went to England when we went to Ireland the airplane stopped there
# one day not long after Paddington went to live with the Browns at number thirty two Windsor Gardens Missus Brown thought she would take him out shopping
# we're going to Portabello Road exclaimed Judy
# it's a big outdoor market quite near here
# you should bring your pocket money added Jonathan
# there's a lot to see
# Paddington didn't need asking twice and soon afterward they all set off
# suddenly they turned a corner and found himself in what seemed like a different world
# a world of outdoor stands and push carts gold and silver ornaments books old furniture fruit and vegetables people
# his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in
# sweetie pie you know what
# you know the you know where your armoire is in your room
# you know where we keep your books in your room
# in your bedroom
# exactly the thing that your diapers are in
# there's a picture on there and Daddy and I bought that picture on Portabello road
# before you were born
# and a picture of a Mommy and her little baby girl
# yeah
# one store was even having its picture taken
# that's a new supermarket explained Judy
# there must be something special going on there
# do we like the supermarket
# what do you get at the supermarket
# that's right
# Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the through the glass
# perhaps I could do some shopping for you Missus Brown he said hopefully
# Missus Brown hesitated
# she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon
# but Jonathan told her not to worry
# even Paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said
# what goes in must come out
# we can meet him back by the check
# Paddington felt most important as he entered the store
# he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door
# that's the manager
# what's he wearing
# a suit right
# and that man's wearing a coat
# what's he wearing around his neck
# a tie you're right
# and what's that man wearing on his face
# what's he wearing on his
# over his eyes
# is he wearing
# that's right he's wearing glasses
# everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans
# there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade
# marmalade's like jam
# do you like jam
# there it is you're right
# he could certainly see why it was called a super market
# his paws were soon full and he was just beginning to wish he's left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming towards him pushing a large basket on wheels
# may I suggest you use one of these sir he called
# you can take as much as you want now he continued
# can I really exclaimed Paddington
# the manager nodded
# yes we like to make our customers happy
# Paddington looked most impressed
# in that case he said I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure
# the more Paddington saw of the super market the more he liked it
# and he was sure Missus Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries
# uhoh
# Paddington thinks he can take them for free
# the other customers looked on in amazement
# perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady as he went by
# but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddington with interest
# since he had been in the sore the manager had been joined by several other important looking men
# and as Paddington reached the check out counter one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap
# Paddington had never been in a store where they tried so hard to make their customers happy and he gave the man a friendly wave
# achoo did someone sneeze
# is your nose stuffy
# do you want Mommy to clean it
# your sneeze fell
# oh
# well done said the lady handing him a ticket
# I hope you've brought a truck with you
# there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here
# Paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw
# over a hundred and fifty dollars worth he gasped
# but I've only got a nickel
# looking up Paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him
# watch out cried the lady as he made a grab for the groceries
# but it was too late
# with a roar like an express train everything began to tumble down off the counter
# oh no it's falling on Paddington
# Paddington was still sitting on the floor covered in groceries
# where's Paddington
# there he is
# he was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the Browns rushed into the store to see what was going on
# all in all he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being
# what's that
# a turkey
# that's right
# you wouldn't think said the manager that giving someone a prize would be so difficult
# a prize echoed the Browns
# and the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall
# this young bear happens to be our thousandth customer today
# that's a big sign
# perhaps you'd like to tell him he's won a free supply of groceries
# all of which said Judy as they staggered home laden with groceries only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet
# even in super markets
# Paddington sniffed the air happily
# I like Portabello road he said
# I think I shall always do my shopping here from now on
# yay
# what book do you wanna read now
# which book is that
# Paddington at the seaside
# great
# he's got some floaties on
# he's got some floats on his arms
# today said Mister Brown at breakfast one bright summer morning feels like the kind of day for taking a young bear to the seaside
# hands up all those who agree
# Jonathan Judy and Missus Brown all put up their hands
# and Paddington raised both his paws as well just to make sure
# there's a tent at the seaside there is we're gonna get to that you're right
# everyone was very excited and by the time they set out the Brown's car was so full of things there was scarcely room to move
# Paddington carefully fastened his seat
# do you think he sits in a special car
# yes I think so too
# are we nearly there Mister Brown he asked hopefully
# he's looking out the window you're right
# Mister Brown removed a shovel handle from his left ear
# I'm afraid not he said gloomily we've only just left Windsor gardens and it's a very long way to the sea
# Mister Brown was right it was a long journey
# but when they reached the seaside the sight of the land and water soon made up for it
# Paddington gave an excited sniff as he climbed out of the car
# even the air had a different smell
# that's because it's special seaside air said Missus Brown it's very good for you
# what are those
# what are those
# remember what type of special bird they are near the ocean
# are they seagulls
# yeah
# you saw a sign with seagulls on Waterman street
# when we were driving back
# she I just taught her seagulls this morning and we were driving back from my sister's &-um when she was at work
# Lily said seagulls seagulls and there's like a
# I don't know some sort of
# like a dental office or something like that that's got seagulls on it
# are you so smart
# yeah
# Paddington looked around anxiously as Mister Brown began laying out beach things
# I hope the air doesn't get used up Missus Brown he said in a loud voice
# and he gave a man doing deep breathing exercises a very hard stare indeed
# come on Paddington called Judy let's go for a swim
# it took Paddington quite a while to get ready
# he wasn't the sort of bear who believed in taking chances and by the time he went into the sea he was wearing so many things he promptly sank
# no wonder cried Judy you haven't even bothered to blow up your paw bands
# fancy wearing a duffel coat in the water exclaimed Jonathan
# I thought the water might be cold said Paddington
# after his paw bands had been properly blown up Paddington went in the water again
# and with some help from Jonathan and Judy he was soon swimming very well indeed
# oh she's got a lollipop
# Paddington had barely closed his eyes when he had heard something very strange going on behind him
# first there was a loud cry
# then there were the sound of people booing
# they're watching Mister Briggs' Punch and Judy explained Missus Brown
# Paddington jumped up
# lollipop
# jumped up and looked at the others as if he could hardly believe his ears
# but Mister and Missus Brown seemed much too busy with the picnic things to be bothered
# oh who's got the ice cream cone
# where's Paddington asked Jonathan when he and Judy arrived back shortly afterwards carrying ice cream cones and an ice stick
# I hope he's not long said Judy I brought him a special cone
# he'll be most upset if it melts
# Jonathan glanced up and down the beach crikey he said look over there
# the Browns gave a gasp as they turned to follow the direction of Jonathan's gaze
# something very odd seemed to be going on inside the Punch and Judy tent
# there was a large bulge on one side and it was heaving up and down almost as if it were alive
# suddenly the tent began moving across the sand scattering people in all directions
# it just missed a large sand castle went twice around the ice cream man and headed toward sea
# quick shouted Judy let's cut it off
# but it was too late
# Paddington cried Judy as a familiar face swam into view
# what on earth are you doing
# that's the second time I've had to rescue you
# Paddington stared at her in amazement
# but I went to rescue you he said
# seagulls
# Missus Brown said you were being punched by Mister Briggs
# Missus Brown
# seagulls
# Missus Brown looked at Paddington in astonishment
# and then her face cleared
# I didn't say Mister Briggs was punching Judy I said it was his Punch and Judy
# it's a puppet theater said Judy
# they often have them at the seaside
# there's one puppet called Mister Punch and when he gets cross all the audience has to boo
# a lollipop
# if it took the Browns a long time to explain a Punch and Judy show to Paddington it took them even longer to explain Paddington to Mister Briggs
# but when he saw the enormous crowd watching his face lit up
# it was the biggest audience he'd had in a long time and decided to make the most of it by putting on another show
# you can have a seat in the front row he said to Paddington
# I expect bears do very good boos
# one way and another Paddington enjoyed his day out at the seaside
# but all good things come to an end and when it was time to leave he stood for a moment holding up an empty marmalade jar
# I'm just collecting some sea air for the journey home he said
# I think I shall sleep so well on the way back I may lose all of today's air with my snores
# yay
# I always like when you get British books the language is written so much nicer than
# right and he did very well indeed or
# things like that which like in some of
# and some of her books are great &-um
# and some of her rhyming books are really good because then she can finish the sentence once she hears it a few times
# like the rhyming helps her but
# you know some of them
# oh my gosh
# wow what books did you bring
# the cookie book
# and the Sam book wow
# you wanna read Sam
# which should we read first Sam or cookies
# Sam
# don't you feel well Sam
# it was a cold cold night on plum street
# in the little white house Missus Bear was putting Sam to bed
# she closed their favorite book and they both blew out the candle
# kiss good_night Sam Missus Bear said and she wrapped him all cozy in the blanket that was red
# but suddenly she heard a cough
# what does a cough sound like
# and there sat Sam curled up and small and coughing in his bed
# Missus Bear put her arms around Sam
# don't you feel well Sam
# Sam shook his head
# poor Saam
# Missus Brown hugged him harder and kissed his warm cheek
# you have a cough she said and she dashed down the stairs and up again with
# the cough syrup
# open wide Sam she said
# Sam shook his head
# tastes bad he said
# yes said his Mama you need to be brave
# Sam put the blanket on his head
# I don't have a cough
# try again Sam said his Mama
# Sam shook the blanket off his head
# he opened up then closed his mouth tight
# the spoon was too big
# too big said Sam
# you can do it Missus Bear said
# I know you can
# Sam opened up then closed his mouth tight
# too much syrup on a too big spoon
# too much said Sam
# Missus Bear rubbed frost off the window and peeked outside
# soon it will snow she said open wide Sam and afterward we'll go downstairs and wait for snow
# snow
# Sam opened wide then very wide
# he sputtered and snorted and made a big face but the syrup went down
# brave Sam he said
# brave Sam
# Missus Bear and Sam held hands on the stairs
# Sam wore his robe that was blue and his slippers were too
# they lit a little fire in the kitchen and made a pot of
# tea
# and Missus Bear put extra
# honey in the tea and it was nice sliding down
# after tea they sat in the big purple chair by the window and waited for snow
# Missus Bear told a story about a bear called Sam
# Sam liked the story so much she told it again
# went the cough every now and then
# Sam leaned back on his Mama's soft belly which wriggled when she talked
# the little fire glowed and the kitchen was warm
# and all through the night Missus Bear and Sam sat in the big purple chair and waited
# and finally it snowed
# but they were fast asleep
# the door that's their door you're right
# and what did they do the next day
# they played in the snow and they made a snow bear you're right
# what's that
# do you know what animal that is
# I think it's a fox cause it's orange
# 0a fox kind of looks like a wolf
# but I think it's a fox
# you wanna read your cookie book

# Lulu
# Norman the doorman
# you wanna read Norman
# Norman
# okay
# okay
# in front of a small well hidden hole
# around and back of the majestic museum of art there once stood a mouse named
# Norman
# Norman was a doorman
# he greeted all the art loving creatures
# she's wearing a dress
# you're right
# you're right
# oh I think he's wearing a lil scarf
# on his neck
# he greeted all the art loving creatures
# who came to see the treasures
# which were kept in the basement of the museum
# come right in Norman would say
# a lil scarf
# and a dress
# right
# right a scarf
# we're quite safe said Norman I sprung all the traps
# oo what do you see
# a bust
# we saw a white bust in the museum here right
# Norman would explain every painting in detail
# and handle each masterpiece masterpiece with as much care
# a sad clown and a statue you're right
# he handled each masterpiece with as much care and respect as if he had painted it himself
# he would also take great pride in pointing out the artistic features of certain pieces of Greek sculpture
# which rested in the dark corners of the storage room
# she is wearing quite a snazzy dress I think
# as oh we missed a page
# Norman's only worry was keeping out of sight of the sharp eyed upstairs guard
# who often came to the basement to set traps for mice
# his bright flashlight frightened the visitors
# I know they're running away from the guard
# yeah
# as for Norman he always managed to escape
# and hide inside an old armored knights helmet
# up there he felt perfectly safe
# actually the helmet was Norman's home
# which he had made into a very comfortable and workable studio
# just see what a splendid sky light the visor made
# like most everybody Norman had a hobby
# each night after work he tried to create something pleasing or beautiful
# perhaps a painting of swiss cheese and crackers or a statue
# one bitter cold day Norman decided to stay in his studio and make something out of wire
# I know he's making something out of wire
# it's a mouse trap
# he took it apart
# and he's taking the wire off of it to make a sculpture right
# right
# he made a trapeze
# that's right
# all through the day and far into the night Norman twisted and bent wires into many strange and mysterious shapes
# until at last he created something he was really proud of
# it looked for all the world like a mouse on a trapeze
# oh yes
# that night when he finally went to sleep he was a tired but happy mouse
# early next morning when Norman went outside to shovel away snow in front of his doorway
# he noticed a man reading a sign nearby
# he read the sign to
# sculpture contest
# open to all artists great and small
# last day today
# back he flew
# why can't I show my wire statue he said
# as he slid through the visor opening
# but what would he call it
# all pieces must have a title he well knew
# suddenly he had an inspiration
# stripping off the printed word trap from the label and ripping off the letters eese from the word cheese he pasted them together
# trapeze
# now he had a fitting title for his wire work
# although Norman was a modest mouse he practically burst a button off his coat
# then as this was the last day for artists to bring their sculpture pieces
# Norman put a cover over his statue as he
# there the mouse is hiding there under the cover
# yeah away he scooted
# up the snowy staircase he climbed
# once inside the huge museum he eagerly followed the other sculptors from one room to another
# he still had to be extremely careful of the guard
# there's a bust you're right
# the other bust is sad
# yes
# the accordion right
# you're right
# what's this
# is that a statue of a woman dancing
# yeah
# she looks like she's having a good time
# don't you think
# yes
# and there's a statue of a man riding a horse
# and a statue of a lil boy and girl holding a balloon
# after carefully removing the cover from his wire statue he left it on the floor with the rest of the contestants work
# out he went into the snowy afternoon knowing he had done his best
# you see he had not forgotten he was a doorman who had a job to do
# she is wearing a dress
# what color is her dress
# oh another dress
# wow
# two dresses what color are they
# yellow and pink
# meanwhile upstairs in the sculpture gallery of the museum
# the judges were busy judging
# oh
# there it is
# quietly and seriously they examined each piece
# trying to find which ones deserved prizes
# gradually they found themselves huddled around a certain statue
# now this is an amazing creation exclaimed one
# there's no name and isn't it a shame it's so tiny
# yes but remember the contest is open to great and small
# one by one each guard when asked if he had knew who had brought it in shook his head and said no not I
# the museum director couldn't understand why none of them had caught sight of the artist
# but when the sharp eyed guard took a closer look he gasped
# so this is where my mouse traps have been going
# I think I know where to start looking for that tricky trap snatcher
# and without waiting another minute the guard snapped on his flash light and hurried downstairs to the basement
# what's this one of my traps stuck in a knights helmet
# he lifted up the visor to investigate
# there inside he saw pieces of wire and parts of traps
# and strangest of all a neat straw bed which could only belong to a mouse
# whoever he is he must be very find of my cheese said the guard
# during all this time Norman had been tending to his duty as a doorman
# a party of mice from the country for whom he had be waiting
# was long passed due
# and he was getting mighty cold and hungry
# but to his surprise who should come around the corner but the sharp eyed guard
# there you are said the guard as Norman fled inside
# but when the guard held a piece of cheese above the hole Norman sniffed it
# he couldn't help poking his nose out to get a better whiff
# and just as he was about to reach up and snatch the cheese a hand came around swiftly and caught Norman by the tail
# are you the rascal who's been taking my mouse traps everyday and using them for artistic purposes asked the guard
# it's just my hobby said Norman
# it's just my hobby
# oh there having a big party
# the guard tossed Norman up on his shoulder
# Norman was sure he was being taken to jail
# you can imagine his surprise when instead they entered the museum and heard the artist all clapping and cheering hooray for trapeze
# hooray for trapeze
# why I'll be bamboozled cried the guard
# I do believe you've won a prize
# the guard rushed right up to the judges platform and said proudly
# here's the winner I found him freezing in the snow
# indeed said the head judge
# why yes who else would could have created the daring mouse on the trapeze
# what is your name my good fellow
# and what would you like for your prize
# if you please sir my name is Norman
# and I'm the doorman downstairs
# and I've always dreamed of seeing the upstairs of the museum without getting caught
# that's what I'd like best
# there's a bust
# and another bust
# and that's
# yes
# the guard led Norman out into the hall
# where together they began a grand tour of the entire art museum
# later that night when Norman returned from returned to his door
# he found his mice friends from the country waiting for him
# of course Norman invited them in where he shared with them an enormous slice of cheese
# a present given to him from the warm hearted guard
# what a wonderful way to end the day
# good night
# yay

# so did I tell you Manuela
# that there you know they come up with all this information now about tuna
# that women of child bearing age shouldn't eat more than a certain amount of tuna because it has mercury in it
# and so pregnant women or people planning to get pregnant shouldn't eat that much tuna and young children and whatever
# so she loves it
# so &-um although not with mayonnaise
# only eats tuna in olive oil
# like she eats italian tuna in olive oil and salt
# I know
# oh she wearing a dress too
# so I called I kept meaning to ask the pediatrician and I forgot to ask her when we were there for our two year appointment
# so I called one day and it's a big practice
# and you know a bunch of doctors running around
# told her I was a patient of Dr Louis I was wondering if you could ask
# yes sweetie pie
# okay sweetie mommy has Hondo and Fabian to if you wanna read it
# oh
# you wanna read that one
# okay
# oh I'm sorry angel
# I'm sorry
# did I just scratch your lil nose
# can I kiss it
# does that feel better
# oh good
# so I call up and I said can you ask if there's does the practice have any guide
# cause she wants everyday for lunch can we have tuna
# so I've only been I've been trying to give it to her once a week
# and she'll eat like a three ounce can
# but even that I'm like it's so hard to wait a whole week to give it to her cause she wants it
# and &-um so I called and the woman's like okay I'll ask like you're crazy
# she gets back on the phone she goes Dr Lang said one to two ounces a week
# so the woman goes my son eats tuna everyday
# so this is what they're recommending for
# so they said a grown woman can have a can of tuna a week and young kids are suppose to have one to two
# I know
# I eat it too
# I know
# I mean I think it's only related to pregnancy
# and young kids but I guess the mercury will affect brain development
# potentially
# you know they said canned tuna has less than fresh tuna it's really I guess it's tuna and swordfish that your suppose to cut back on
# but one to two if they're really suggesting one to two ounces a week I can't believe that they don't hand this out on a flyer to people
# she would literally eat it everyday if she could
# I know literally the small the tiny can with the flip
# top that you'll buy for lunch that comes with crackers or whatever
# that's three ounces and it's like this big tiny
# right or anyone who can potentially become pregnant
# right
# what would you like sweetie
# you can climb under and get it
# I don't know what she's looking for actually
# you can scoot over and get that honey
# can you say thank you Manuela
