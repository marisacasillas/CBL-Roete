# djou wanna read Frederick
# okay it's right next to Manuela
# can you say thank you
# Frederic
# all along the meadow where the cows grazed and the horses ran there was an old stone wall
# in that wall not far from the barn and the granary a chatty family of field mice had their home
# that's right nuts and wheat
# but the farmers had moved away the barn was abandoned and the granary stood empty
# and since winter was not far off the little mice began to gather corn and nuts and wheat and straw
# and they all worked day and night all except Frederick
# Frederick looks like he's asleep
# Frederick why don't you work they asked
# I do work they're carrying corn
# I gather sun rays for the cold dark winter days
# and when they saw Frederick sitting there staring at the they said
# nuts and wheat
# they said and now Frederick I gather colors answered Frederick simply for winter is gray
# that's right
# and once Frederick seemed half asleep are you dreaming Frederick they asked reproachfully but Frederick said oh no I'm gathering words for the winter days are long and many and we'll run out of things to say
# huh what's coming down
# snow
# the winter days came and when the first snow fell the five little field mice took to their hideout in the stones
# &-um they're eating cookies wow they're lucky
# in the beginning there was lots to eat and the mice told stories of foolish foxes and silly cats and they were a happy family
# they were very happy
# but little by little they had nibbled up most of the nuts and berries the straw was gone and the corn was only a memory
# it was cold in the wall and no one felt like chatting
# and then they remembered what Frederick had said about sun rays and colors and words what about your supplies Frederick
# close your eyes said Frederick as he climbed on a big stone I send you the rays of sun
# do you feel their golden glow and as Frederick spoke of the sun the four little mice began to feel warmer was it Frederick's voice
# was it magic
# and what about the colors Frederick close your eyes again he said and he told them of the blue periwinkles the red poppies and the yellow wheat and the green leaves of the berry bush
# and they saw the colors as clearly if they had been painted in their minds
# and the words Frederick
# Frederick cleared his throat waited a moment and then said as if from a stage aren't we lucky the seasons are four what if there was one less or one more
# why Frederick they said you're a poet Frederick blushed took a bow and said shyly I know it
# I know it
# another book
# you wanna get some from mommy's room I think she's got better books in her room
# no okay
# ah little miss spider
# she's holding an apple
# hm yummy
# what's that
# that's honey hive

# whoopsie
# my mom found them for me in New York and I love them
# and em they're crunchy and em they make peaches and apples and soybeans
# and the soybeans they makes a sweet and spicy or sweet and sour they make an indian spice which is really good and they make a jalapeno which I didn't try cause I don't like that
# &-um yeah
# and &-uh so so now I have_to order them over the internet to get them because they don't sell them here yet but it turns out that the woman who lives who grew up a block from where I grew up in New York went to R_I_S_D too
# so it was really funny
# froggy log
# and taddy puddle
# and
# firefly falls
# and a a tree
# more trees
# more trees
# acorn alley
# huh lil miss spider's home she lives in the tree
# should we read it
# little miss spider got ready for school she packed her new notebook her pencils and
# peering outside she sipped tea from her cup and eagerly watched for the sun to come
# up
# she dreamt as she gazed her mind running through the wonderful things she'd learn how to do
# huh wow look at all the things
# she's painting
# she's reading
# she's doing science experiments
# doing math she's adding her numbers she's swinging she's flying she's playing with a ball she's skipping rope and she's learning her alphabet too
# mhm
# sunny patch school was the best place to go to study lessons that all bugs ought_to know
# there were classes and climbing and clinging to walls for hiding in bushes and curling in balls
# she would learn about flowers from petal to root how to chew tasty leaves and tunnel through fruit
# yummy
# she gobbled her breakfast a fresh flower plate and ran the whole way to be first at the gate
# the principal smiled as he pulled back the latch I know you'll be happy at dear sunny patch
# but she found she lacked talent for hiding in trees for chirping like crickets or humming like bees
# she hadn't the strength to drill leaves with her tongue and hardly the stomach for digging in dung
# I am useless at stinging she said with a sigh perhaps I'll be better at learning to fly
# there's little miss spider
# she is sad
# each student was tossed from a leaf of a rose poor little miss spider fell flat on her
# nose
# the school day was over they sounded the bell she sobbed is there anything I can do well
# then she heard a bug cry I'm stuck in a spout and she climbed to the top and hoisted him out
# that's the bug I think he's an ant
# right
# the principal beamed as he watched from afar he lifted miss spider and gave her a
# a star
# our gifts they are many we hop fly and crawl but kindness he said is the finest of all
# huh sunny patch school
# honey hive
# froggy bog and taddy puddle

# Paddington's lucky day
# ooh boy
# you wanna sit on Mommy's lap and we'll read the book
# okay
# whoop
# you come sit on Mommy's lap
# mm
# Paddington's lucky day
# you know Paddington lives in England
# we went to England when we went to Ireland the airplane stopped there
# one day not long after Paddington went to live with the Browns at number thirty two Windsor Gardens Missus Brown thought she would take him out shopping
# we're going to Portabello Road exclaimed Judy
# it's a big outdoor market quite near here
# you should bring your pocket money added Jonathan
# there's a lot to see
# Paddington didn't need asking twice and soon afterward they all set off
# suddenly they turned a corner and found himself in what seemed like a different world
# a world of outdoor stands and push carts gold and silver ornaments books old furniture fruit and vegetables people
# his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in
# sweetie pie you know what
# you know the you know where your armoire is in your room
# you know where we keep your books in your room
# in your bedroom
# exactly the thing that your diapers are in
# there's a picture on there and Daddy and I bought that picture on Portabello road
# before you were born
# and a picture of a Mommy and her little baby girl
# yeah
# one store was even having its picture taken
# that's a new supermarket explained Judy
# there must be something special going on there
# do we like the supermarket
# what do you get at the supermarket
# that's right
# Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the through the glass
# perhaps I could do some shopping for you Missus Brown he said hopefully
# Missus Brown hesitated
# she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon
# but Jonathan told her not to worry
# even Paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said
# what goes in must come out
# we can meet him back by the check
# Paddington felt most important as he entered the store
# he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door
# that's the manager
# what's he wearing
# a suit right
# and that man's wearing a coat
# what's he wearing around his neck
# a tie you're right
# and what's that man wearing on his face
# what's he wearing on his
# over his eyes
# is he wearing
# that's right he's wearing glasses
# everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans
# there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade
# marmalade's like jam
# do you like jam
# there it is you're right
# he could certainly see why it was called a super market
# his paws were soon full and he was just beginning to wish he's left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming towards him pushing a large basket on wheels
# may I suggest you use one of these sir he called
# you can take as much as you want now he continued
# can I really exclaimed Paddington
# the manager nodded
# yes we like to make our customers happy
# Paddington looked most impressed
# in that case he said I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure
# the more Paddington saw of the super market the more he liked it
# and he was sure Missus Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries
# uhoh
# Paddington thinks he can take them for free
# the other customers looked on in amazement
# perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady as he went by
# but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddington with interest
# since he had been in the sore the manager had been joined by several other important looking men
# and as Paddington reached the check out counter one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap
# Paddington had never been in a store where they tried so hard to make their customers happy and he gave the man a friendly wave
# achoo did someone sneeze
# is your nose stuffy
# do you want Mommy to clean it
# your sneeze fell
# oh
# well done said the lady handing him a ticket
# I hope you've brought a truck with you
# there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here
# Paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw
# over a hundred and fifty dollars worth he gasped
# but I've only got a nickel
# looking up Paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him
# watch out cried the lady as he made a grab for the groceries
# but it was too late
# with a roar like an express train everything began to tumble down off the counter
# oh no it's falling on Paddington
# Paddington was still sitting on the floor covered in groceries
# where's Paddington
# there he is
# he was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the Browns rushed into the store to see what was going on
# all in all he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being
# what's that
# a turkey
# that's right
# you wouldn't think said the manager that giving someone a prize would be so difficult
# a prize echoed the Browns
# and the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall
# this young bear happens to be our thousandth customer today
# that's a big sign
# perhaps you'd like to tell him he's won a free supply of groceries
# all of which said Judy as they staggered home laden with groceries only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet
# even in super markets
# Paddington sniffed the air happily
# I like Portabello road he said
# I think I shall always do my shopping here from now on
# yay
# what book do you wanna read now
# which book is that
# Paddington at the seaside
# great
# he's got some floaties on
# he's got some floats on his arms
# today said Mister Brown at breakfast one bright summer morning feels like the kind of day for taking a young bear to the seaside
# hands up all those who agree
# Jonathan Judy and Missus Brown all put up their hands
# and Paddington raised both his paws as well just to make sure
# there's a tent at the seaside there is we're gonna get to that you're right
# everyone was very excited and by the time they set out the Brown's car was so full of things there was scarcely room to move
# Paddington carefully fastened his seat
# do you think he sits in a special car
# yes I think so too
# are we nearly there Mister Brown he asked hopefully
# he's looking out the window you're right
# Mister Brown removed a shovel handle from his left ear
# I'm afraid not he said gloomily we've only just left Windsor gardens and it's a very long way to the sea
# Mister Brown was right it was a long journey
# but when they reached the seaside the sight of the land and water soon made up for it
# Paddington gave an excited sniff as he climbed out of the car
# even the air had a different smell
# that's because it's special seaside air said Missus Brown it's very good for you
# what are those
# what are those
# remember what type of special bird they are near the ocean
# are they seagulls
# yeah
# you saw a sign with seagulls on Waterman street
# when we were driving back
# she I just taught her seagulls this morning and we were driving back from my sister's &-um when she was at work
# Lily said seagulls seagulls and there's like a
# I don't know some sort of
# like a dental office or something like that that's got seagulls on it
# are you so smart
# yeah
# Paddington looked around anxiously as Mister Brown began laying out beach things
# I hope the air doesn't get used up Missus Brown he said in a loud voice
# and he gave a man doing deep breathing exercises a very hard stare indeed
# come on Paddington called Judy let's go for a swim
# it took Paddington quite a while to get ready
# he wasn't the sort of bear who believed in taking chances and by the time he went into the sea he was wearing so many things he promptly sank
# no wonder cried Judy you haven't even bothered to blow up your paw bands
# fancy wearing a duffel coat in the water exclaimed Jonathan
# I thought the water might be cold said Paddington
# after his paw bands had been properly blown up Paddington went in the water again
# and with some help from Jonathan and Judy he was soon swimming very well indeed
# oh she's got a lollipop
# Paddington had barely closed his eyes when he had heard something very strange going on behind him
# first there was a loud cry
# then there were the sound of people booing
# they're watching Mister Briggs' Punch and Judy explained Missus Brown
# Paddington jumped up
# lollipop
# jumped up and looked at the others as if he could hardly believe his ears
# but Mister and Missus Brown seemed much too busy with the picnic things to be bothered
# oh who's got the ice cream cone
# where's Paddington asked Jonathan when he and Judy arrived back shortly afterwards carrying ice cream cones and an ice stick
# I hope he's not long said Judy I brought him a special cone
# he'll be most upset if it melts
# Jonathan glanced up and down the beach crikey he said look over there
# the Browns gave a gasp as they turned to follow the direction of Jonathan's gaze
# something very odd seemed to be going on inside the Punch and Judy tent
# there was a large bulge on one side and it was heaving up and down almost as if it were alive
# suddenly the tent began moving across the sand scattering people in all directions
# it just missed a large sand castle went twice around the ice cream man and headed toward sea
# quick shouted Judy let's cut it off
# but it was too late
# Paddington cried Judy as a familiar face swam into view
# what on earth are you doing
# that's the second time I've had to rescue you
# Paddington stared at her in amazement
# but I went to rescue you he said
# seagulls
# Missus Brown said you were being punched by Mister Briggs
# Missus Brown
# seagulls
# Missus Brown looked at Paddington in astonishment
# and then her face cleared
# I didn't say Mister Briggs was punching Judy I said it was his Punch and Judy
# it's a puppet theater said Judy
# they often have them at the seaside
# there's one puppet called Mister Punch and when he gets cross all the audience has to boo
# a lollipop
# if it took the Browns a long time to explain a Punch and Judy show to Paddington it took them even longer to explain Paddington to Mister Briggs
# but when he saw the enormous crowd watching his face lit up
# it was the biggest audience he'd had in a long time and decided to make the most of it by putting on another show
# you can have a seat in the front row he said to Paddington
# I expect bears do very good boos
# one way and another Paddington enjoyed his day out at the seaside
# but all good things come to an end and when it was time to leave he stood for a moment holding up an empty marmalade jar
# I'm just collecting some sea air for the journey home he said
# I think I shall sleep so well on the way back I may lose all of today's air with my snores
# yay
# I always like when you get British books the language is written so much nicer than
# right and he did very well indeed or
# things like that which like in some of
# and some of her books are great &-um
# and some of her rhyming books are really good because then she can finish the sentence once she hears it a few times
# like the rhyming helps her but

# oh my gosh
# wow what books did you bring
# the cookie book
# and the Sam book wow
# you wanna read Sam
# which should we read first Sam or cookies
# Sam
# don't you feel well Sam
# it was a cold cold night on plum street
# in the little white house Missus Bear was putting Sam to bed
# she closed their favorite book and they both blew out the candle
# kiss good_night Sam Missus Bear said and she wrapped him all cozy in the blanket that was red
# but suddenly she heard a cough
# what does a cough sound like
# and there sat Sam curled up and small and coughing in his bed
# Missus Bear put her arms around Sam
# don't you feel well Sam
# Sam shook his head
# poor Saam
# Missus Brown hugged him harder and kissed his warm cheek
# you have a cough she said and she dashed down the stairs and up again with
# the cough syrup
# open wide Sam she said
# Sam shook his head
# tastes bad he said
# yes said his Mama you need to be brave
# Sam put the blanket on his head
# I don't have a cough
# try again Sam said his Mama
# Sam shook the blanket off his head
# he opened up then closed his mouth tight
# the spoon was too big
# too big said Sam
# you can do it Missus Bear said
# I know you can
# Sam opened up then closed his mouth tight
# too much syrup on a too big spoon
# too much said Sam
# Missus Bear rubbed frost off the window and peeked outside
# soon it will snow she said open wide Sam and afterward we'll go downstairs and wait for snow
# snow
# Sam opened wide then very wide
# he sputtered and snorted and made a big face but the syrup went down
# brave Sam he said
# brave Sam
# Missus Bear and Sam held hands on the stairs
# Sam wore his robe that was blue and his slippers were too
# they lit a little fire in the kitchen and made a pot of
# tea
# and Missus Bear put extra
# honey in the tea and it was nice sliding down
# after tea they sat in the big purple chair by the window and waited for snow
# Missus Bear told a story about a bear called Sam
# Sam liked the story so much she told it again
# went the cough every now and then
# Sam leaned back on his Mama's soft belly which wriggled when she talked
# the little fire glowed and the kitchen was warm
# and all through the night Missus Bear and Sam sat in the big purple chair and waited
# and finally it snowed
# but they were fast asleep
# the door that's their door you're right
# and what did they do the next day
# they played in the snow and they made a snow bear you're right
# what's that
# do you know what animal that is
# I think it's a fox cause it's orange
# 0a fox kind of looks like a wolf
# but I think it's a fox
# you wanna read your cookie book

# Charles said his father you're a jelly roll
# you're just a cowardly custard
# you're like a sandwich without the bread not to mention the ham and mustard
# how will you ever go to school or find a job or get married
# Charles sat down and cried so hard
# he had to be carried
# then Charles's father murmured low a babysitter's coming tonight
# you know the one it's Missus Block and everything will be alright
# the sun went down and the sitter came his parents left at six o'clock

# made of marble
# and Norman the doorman likes
# right and Norman the doorman works at the museum in the blue book
# yes you're right

# you wanna go get another book
# okay want Mama to go get a book

# okay
# why don't you go talk to Manuela
# and I'll go get Norman the doorman
# with Norman the doorman
# yay
# that's right
# lots_of books
# lots
# ah books
# what book is that
# Lulu
# Norman the doorman
# you wanna read Norman
# Norman
# okay
# okay
# in front of a small well hidden hole
# around and back of the majestic museum of art there once stood a mouse named
# Norman
# Norman was a doorman
# he greeted all the art loving creatures
# she's wearing a dress
# you're right
# you're right
# oh I think he's wearing a lil scarf
# on his neck
# he greeted all the art loving creatures
# who came to see the treasures
# which were kept in the basement of the museum
# come right in Norman would say
# a lil scarf
# and a dress
# right
# right a scarf
# we're quite safe said Norman I sprung all the traps
# oo what do you see
# a bust
# we saw a white bust in the museum here right
# Norman would explain every painting in detail
# and handle each masterpiece masterpiece with as much care
# a sad clown and a statue you're right
# he handled each masterpiece with as much care and respect as if he had painted it himself
# he would also take great pride in pointing out the artistic features of certain pieces of Greek sculpture
# which rested in the dark corners of the storage room
# she is wearing quite a snazzy dress I think
# as oh we missed a page
# Norman's only worry was keeping out of sight of the sharp eyed upstairs guard
# who often came to the basement to set traps for mice
# his bright flashlight frightened the visitors
# I know they're running away from the guard
# yeah
# as for Norman he always managed to escape
# and hide inside an old armored knights helmet
# up there he felt perfectly safe
# actually the helmet was Norman's home
# which he had made into a very comfortable and workable studio
# just see what a splendid sky light the visor made
# like most everybody Norman had a hobby
# each night after work he tried to create something pleasing or beautiful
# perhaps a painting of swiss cheese and crackers or a statue
# one bitter cold day Norman decided to stay in his studio and make something out of wire
# I know he's making something out of wire
# it's a mouse trap
# he took it apart
# and he's taking the wire off of it to make a sculpture right
# right
# he made a trapeze
# that's right
# all through the day and far into the night Norman twisted and bent wires into many strange and mysterious shapes
# until at last he created something he was really proud of
# it looked for all the world like a mouse on a trapeze
# oh yes
# that night when he finally went to sleep he was a tired but happy mouse
# early next morning when Norman went outside to shovel away snow in front of his doorway
# he noticed a man reading a sign nearby
# he read the sign to
# sculpture contest
# open to all artists great and small
# last day today
# back he flew
# why can't I show my wire statue he said
# as he slid through the visor opening
# but what would he call it
# all pieces must have a title he well knew
# suddenly he had an inspiration
# stripping off the printed word trap from the label and ripping off the letters eese from the word cheese he pasted them together
# trapeze
# now he had a fitting title for his wire work
# although Norman was a modest mouse he practically burst a button off his coat
# then as this was the last day for artists to bring their sculpture pieces
# Norman put a cover over his statue as he
# there the mouse is hiding there under the cover
# yeah away he scooted
# up the snowy staircase he climbed
# once inside the huge museum he eagerly followed the other sculptors from one room to another
# he still had to be extremely careful of the guard
# there's a bust you're right
# the other bust is sad
# yes
# the accordion right
# you're right
# what's this
# is that a statue of a woman dancing
# yeah
# she looks like she's having a good time
# don't you think
# yes
# and there's a statue of a man riding a horse
# and a statue of a lil boy and girl holding a balloon
# after carefully removing the cover from his wire statue he left it on the floor with the rest of the contestants work
# out he went into the snowy afternoon knowing he had done his best
# you see he had not forgotten he was a doorman who had a job to do
# she is wearing a dress
# what color is her dress
# oh another dress
# wow
# two dresses what color are they
# yellow and pink
# meanwhile upstairs in the sculpture gallery of the museum
# the judges were busy judging
# oh
# there it is
# quietly and seriously they examined each piece
# trying to find which ones deserved prizes
# gradually they found themselves huddled around a certain statue
# now this is an amazing creation exclaimed one
# there's no name and isn't it a shame it's so tiny
# yes but remember the contest is open to great and small
# one by one each guard when asked if he had knew who had brought it in shook his head and said no not I
# the museum director couldn't understand why none of them had caught sight of the artist
# but when the sharp eyed guard took a closer look he gasped
# so this is where my mouse traps have been going
# I think I know where to start looking for that tricky trap snatcher
# and without waiting another minute the guard snapped on his flash light and hurried downstairs to the basement
# what's this one of my traps stuck in a knights helmet
# he lifted up the visor to investigate
# there inside he saw pieces of wire and parts of traps
# and strangest of all a neat straw bed which could only belong to a mouse
# whoever he is he must be very find of my cheese said the guard
# during all this time Norman had been tending to his duty as a doorman
# a party of mice from the country for whom he had be waiting
# was long passed due
# and he was getting mighty cold and hungry
# but to his surprise who should come around the corner but the sharp eyed guard
# there you are said the guard as Norman fled inside
# but when the guard held a piece of cheese above the hole Norman sniffed it
# he couldn't help poking his nose out to get a better whiff
# and just as he was about to reach up and snatch the cheese a hand came around swiftly and caught Norman by the tail
# are you the rascal who's been taking my mouse traps everyday and using them for artistic purposes asked the guard
# it's just my hobby said Norman
# it's just my hobby
# oh there having a big party
# the guard tossed Norman up on his shoulder
# Norman was sure he was being taken to jail
# you can imagine his surprise when instead they entered the museum and heard the artist all clapping and cheering hooray for trapeze
# hooray for trapeze
# why I'll be bamboozled cried the guard
# I do believe you've won a prize
# the guard rushed right up to the judges platform and said proudly
# here's the winner I found him freezing in the snow
# indeed said the head judge
# why yes who else would could have created the daring mouse on the trapeze
# what is your name my good fellow
# and what would you like for your prize
# if you please sir my name is Norman
# and I'm the doorman downstairs
# and I've always dreamed of seeing the upstairs of the museum without getting caught
# that's what I'd like best
# there's a bust
# and another bust
# and that's
# yes
# the guard led Norman out into the hall
# where together they began a grand tour of the entire art museum
# later that night when Norman returned from returned to his door
# he found his mice friends from the country waiting for him
# of course Norman invited them in where he shared with them an enormous slice of cheese
# a present given to him from the warm hearted guard
# what a wonderful way to end the day
# good night

# so did I tell you Manuela
# that there you know they come up with all this information now about tuna
# that women of child bearing age shouldn't eat more than a certain amount of tuna because it has mercury in it
# and so pregnant women or people planning to get pregnant shouldn't eat that much tuna and young children and whatever
# so she loves it
# so &-um although not with mayonnaise
# only eats tuna in olive oil
# like she eats italian tuna in olive oil and salt
# I know
# oh she wearing a dress too
# so I called I kept meaning to ask the pediatrician and I forgot to ask her when we were there for our two year appointment
# so I called one day and it's a big practice
# and you know a bunch of doctors running around
# told her I was a patient of Dr Louis I was wondering if you could ask
# yes sweetie pie
# okay sweetie mommy has Hondo and Fabian to if you wanna read it
# oh
# you wanna read that one
# okay
# oh I'm sorry angel
# I'm sorry
# did I just scratch your lil nose
# can I kiss it
# does that feel better
# oh good
# so I call up and I said can you ask if there's does the practice have any guide
# cause she wants everyday for lunch can we have tuna
# so I've only been I've been trying to give it to her once a week
# and she'll eat like a three ounce can
# but even that I'm like it's so hard to wait a whole week to give it to her cause she wants it
# and &-um so I called and the woman's like okay I'll ask like you're crazy
# she gets back on the phone she goes Dr Lang said one to two ounces a week
# so the woman goes my son eats tuna everyday
# so this is what they're recommending for
# so they said a grown woman can have a can of tuna a week and young kids are suppose to have one to two
# I know
# I eat it too
# I know
# I mean I think it's only related to pregnancy
# and young kids but I guess the mercury will affect brain development
# potentially
# you know they said canned tuna has less than fresh tuna it's really I guess it's tuna and swordfish that your suppose to cut back on
# but one to two if they're really suggesting one to two ounces a week I can't believe that they don't hand this out on a flyer to people
# she would literally eat it everyday if she could
# I know literally the small the tiny can with the flip
# top that you'll buy for lunch that comes with crackers or whatever
# that's three ounces and it's like this big tiny
# right or anyone who can potentially become pregnant
# right
# what would you like sweetie
# you can climb under and get it
# I don't know what she's looking for actually
# you can scoot over and get that honey
# can you say thank you Manuela
