# just then Harold landed
# I have it sir he said
# and he told Thomas and Sir Topham Hatt what happened
# finally Sir Topham Hatt opened the urgent package
# what could be inside
# a new hat right
# it's a shiny new hat
# just in time for tonight's big party Sir Topham Hatt said putting the hat on his head
# and Thomas next time there is an urgent package

# I don't know
# it's a  I don't know
# I don't know what it's called it's called a kerchief

# Toby and the flood
# it had been raining hard for weeks
# Toby was feeling miserable
# everywhere was
# wet
# wet
# wet
# that's a dam
# an the water's coming through
# it's like a big wall an the water is pouring through
# only the great wall known as a dam was stopping the water from overflowing
# Percy arrived just as Toby was about to expect the dam for any damage
# driver tells me it may be dangerous up there careful Toby
# I'll try said Toby bravely
# Percy watched anxiously as Toby trundled away
# there he goes over that bridge
# his journey took him over a wooden bridge at the edge of the village
# the river surged dangerously beneath it
# the water's getting higher and higher
# the river's getting higher and higher
# just like in the
# just like in that other story
# the &-um what story
# about the tugboat
# Scuffy
# Harold the Helicopter was inspecting the dam as Toby arrived
# be brave Toby called his driver
# we have_to cross to the other side
# the dam did not look safe at all and Toby was worried
# soon he knew why
# it broke
# see the wall broke
# the dam's breaking up
# we must warn everyone
# Toby shunted back as fast as his wheels would let him
# Percy was waiting anxiously for Toby by the bridge
# the river had risen so high that the bridge was in danger of collapsing
# the dam's breaking up we must find high ground
# shouted Toby's driver
# your only chance is to cross the bridge called Toby
# called Percy
# it doesn't look safe to me wailed Toby
# yeah
# Thomas look at it break up like that an the water's rushing through
# it's our only chance said his driver
# if the dam breaks we'll be
# we'll be
# done for yep
# Toby was halfway across when disaster struck
# help called Toby
# we'll follow him on our line
# it meets the river further down
# as Toby floated helplessly in the flood waters they passed a sign that made them shudder
# what does it say
# beware the waterfall that's right
# if we go over that waterfall we're
# doomed
# then they saw Harold who slooped
# swooped
# you wanna lie down
# okay
# you're a tired little pumpkin today huh
# let's see
# we're gonna drop a rope to you
# attach it to yourself
# quickly now
# and they did
# to one of Toby's buffers
# just then Percy arrived
# Harold flew over to him
# catch the rope and pull Toby to safety
# he called
# Toby was safe at last
# see
# Percy's pulling Toby
# an he's attached to a rope
# oof
# when the floods were over and the dam mended the villagers had a big party for Toby hosted by Sir Topham Hatt
# you were very brave Toby
# thanks to Harold
# I never could've been so brave Toby said Percy
# oh I'm sure you would be
# but you never know til you've tried
# Percy rather hoped he would never have_to
# what story's this
# a better view for Gordon that's right
# Gordon was feeling grumpy
# this was making James cross
# why are you complaining all the time
# because I'm a big engine and I know everything
# I shall complain whenever I want
# you're just a small engine with ideas above your station
# I can't see any said Percy where are they
# any what
# ideas above the station
# the sky's empty
# like your smoke
# laughed James
# but Gordon was still grumpy
# one day I'll show you just what a big engine can really do
# not speak to silly little green
# so what can a big engine really do
# not speak to silly little green engines for a start replied Gordon
# then he puffed away
# later that day Sir Topham Hatt came to see him
# Gordon you'll be making one stop today with an empty express to test our new station
# you can make up time afterwards
# why can't Henry do it
# he likes idling in stations
# you will do as you are told
# so Gordon did but he was still unhappy
# an he grew sick too
# Gordon was sick
# mm can you see his face
# there it is
# he's making a funny face
# mm
# I can't do it
# do I look like Gordon
# you look funny too
# I just can't get up to speed he moaned
# it's time for your visit to the works
# he moaned and he groaned
# your pipes are clogged said the fireman
# at last they approached the new station
# Gordon was impressed but his mood soon changed
# in front of him was a blank wall an huge buffers
# what a boring view
# important engines like me should have a panoramic view where I can see people and people can see me
# and he weeshed angrily
# weesh
# weesh
# Gordon was happy when it was time to leave
# now you can really enjoy your run as long as your pipes will let you said his driver
# come on come on I can go faster than this puffed Gordon
# sick
# me
# never
# but Gordon began to feel more and more feeble
# that means weak
# soon he came to a complete stop
# what happened
# his driver and his fireman inspected him
# something's broken inside you said the fireman
# now you really will have_to go to the works
# Gordon was still angry when James arrived to collect his cookies
# well well well
# so much for knowing about everything
# you got too puffed up in your boiler so it serves you right
# serves you right serves you right
# when Gordon returned from the works a few days later he was still boasting
# I am the finest engine on the island of Sodor
# probably the finest in the world
# come on Gordon we're going to the new official opening of the station
# then there was trouble
# as Gordon approached the station
# neither the fire
# driver or the fireman could apply his brakes
# something had jammed
# the driver reduced steam but Gordon was still going too fast
# help me please
# he pleaded to him
# well Gordon said Sir Topham Hatt I knew you wanted a panoramic view but this is not the way to achieve it
# what did Gordon say
# yes so sorry sir
# yes so sorry sir
# when Gordon was repaired again he took Sir Topham Hatt to the new station for its second official opening
# this time he arrived safely an everyone clapped and cheered as he pulled in

# yep
# you want your bottle
# where did I put it
# oh I put it up here
# you're sleepy huh
# I have my drink
# you have your drink
# Harold and the purple crayon
# one evening
# after thinking it over for some time
# Harold decided to go for a walk in the
# moonlight
# there wasn't any moon
# and Harold
# needed a moon oh
# needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight
# and he needed something to walk on
# he made a long straight path so he wouldn't get lost
# and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him
# there it is
# but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path
# so he left the path for a shortcut across a field
# and the moon went with him
# the shortcut led right to where Harold thought a forest ought_to be
# he didn't want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest with
# just one tree in it
# that's right
# it turned out to be an
# yep
# the apples would be very tasty Harold thought when they got red
# so he put a
# yep a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples
# it was a terrible frightening dragon
# it even frightened Harold he backed away
# his hand holding the purple crayon
# shook
# yep
# suddenly he realized
# that's right your hands are shaking
# that's right he's falling right into the water
# by then Harold was over his head
# in an ocean hm
# mhm
# just like you were in the ocean the other day
# he came up thinking fast
# and
# thinking fast and thinking big heh
# he's thinking a lot yep
# he has to think a lot cause he has a lot of adventures so he has to
# he has to
# protect himself
# and in no time at all he was climbing aboard a
# a trim little boat
# he quickly set sail
# and the moon sailed along with him
# mhm
# and what did he draw
# mhm
# the sailboat
# after he had sailed long enough Harold made land without much trouble
# he stepped ashore on the beach
# mhm
# wondering where he was
# where was he
# right
# the sandy beach reminded Harold of
# yep picnics
# and the thought of picnics made him hungry so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch what was his lunch
# yep lots_of pies
# there was nothing but pie
# but they were all nine kinds of pie that Harold liked best
# when Harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left
# he hated so to see so much pie go to waste so Harold left
# mhm and a
# yep the moose is gonna eat the pie up and what is the other animal he left
# a porcupine a deserving porcupine to finish it up
# and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was
# mhm a moose and a porcupine they're gonna finish up all the pie
# Harold knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see
# so he decided to make the hill into a
# yep mountain
# if he went high enough he thought he could see the window of his bedroom
# he was tired and he felt he ought_to be getting to bed
# he hoped he could see his bedroom window from the top of the mountain
# but what happened
# as he looked down over the other side he
# yep he slipped
# and there wasn't any other side of the mountain he was falling in
# thin air but luckily
# right he kept his wits and his purple crayon
# he made a balloon and he grabbed on to it
# and he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in
# he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn't see his window
# no I can see your window right over there right over there too
# you have two windows in your bedroom
# and usually the moon is
# we can see the moon out that window
# at night
# he couldn't even see a house
# so he made a house
# with windows
# two houses yup
# and he landed the balloon on the grass in the front
# looks like your house
# none of the windows was his window
# he tried to think where his window ought_to be
# he made some more windows
# he made a big building full of windows
# he made lots_of buildings full of windows
# he made a whole city full of windows
# it does look like New York City and there's the moon it's still there
# but none of the windows was his window
# he couldn't think where it might be
# yep
# that's right
# he decided to ask a policeman
# the policeman pointed the way Harold was going anyway
# but Harold thanked him
# he followed the way
# as he walked a
# and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in bed
# you gonna walk straight to your bed
# then suddenly Harold remembered
# he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon
# going to your bed
# just like Harold did
# the purple and brown book that's what color it is
# mixed up
# like your color and like your eyes are a little bit blue
# and a little bit green
# now this book is a lot brown and some purple
# a different color purple
# that's a color purple and that's a different color purple
# he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon it was always right around the moon
# that's right
# we're both wearing stripes Ethan
# my shirt is stripy and your shirt is stripy
# you wanna mix our shirts together
# mix mix mix mix mix
# and then we would have a new stripy shirt
# and then Harold made his bed
# he got in it
# and he drew up the covers
# the purple crayon dropped on the floor and Harold dropped off to sleep
# year after year after year after year
# ear after ear and year after year
# oh here's my ponytail holder
# did you like it when I have a ponytail
# you'd
